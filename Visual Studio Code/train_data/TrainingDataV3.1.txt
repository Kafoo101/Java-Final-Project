science editors note this post is part of a series produced by huffposts girls in stem mentorship program join the community as we discuss issues affecting women in science technology engineering and math if amelia earhart were alive today there is a good chance she would be a nasa astronaut i say that not only because of earharts noted passion for breaking barriers of possibility in flight but also for her determination to break barriers of exclusion here on earth at a time when women and minorities were rarely seen in the cockpit of an airplane amelia earharts pioneering achievements broke the silence barrier inspired a nation and paved the way for so many others who have followed in her path she holds a special place in our hearts at nasa it is no secret that the requirement that our earliest astronauts be military test pilots essentially precluded applications from women it was not until 1983 that sally ride became the first american woman in space as part of a space shuttle challenger mission to deploy communications satellites since then there have been 43 nasa women astronauts who have taken that leap and proven as amelia earhart once said that men and women were equal in jobs requiring intelligence coordination speed coolness and willpower as we celebrate amelia earhart day in recognition of one her greatest accomplishments the first person to fly solo over the pacific on january 11 1935 i want to salute the contributions that both she and the field of aeronautics have made to our nation while nasa was not officially born until 1958 twentyone years after earhart disappeared during her 1937 attempt to become the first woman to fly around the world she had a connection to the agency in 1928 the same year that she became the first woman to fly the atlantic amelia earhart paid a visit to the national advisory committee on aeronautics naca langley research center in hampton virginia for a tour of the facility responsible for so many of the innovations that were on aircraft she flew naca became nasa in 1958 and langley remains an important part of a larger and often overlooked part of the nasa mission portfolio aeronautics research while there were probably no other women pilots at langley in 1928 earhart very well could have met a number of women researchers who worked there as naca was an early incubator for the inclusion of women scientists earharts visit not only demonstrated that women could play leading roles in aeronautics it also signaled how important nasa innovations and aeronautics research would be to the future of aviation and space flight if amelia earhart were alive today there is a good chance she would be a nasa astronaut today nasa technologies are aboard all us commercial and military aircraft and in use in every us air traffic control tower every time you step aboard an airplane theres an excellent chance a piece of innovative nasa technology is flying with you helping to ensure a safe and efficient flight it might be found in the upturned winglets you see at the tip of the wing which help reduce drag and save fuel or inside the increasingly fuelefficient and quiet jet engines slung beneath the wings it might even be found in the software tools that air traffic controllers use to safely guide flights to their destinations or move them more efficiently through the sky nasa is continuing to push the envelope of innovation as amelia did in her own way to transform the way we fly such as making it possible to travel in a commercial aircraft at supersonic speeds or to have higher levels of automation and autonomy across the aviation system in fact the acronym amelia turned out to be the name of an innovative aircraft model recently tested in a nasa wind tunnel these women of nasa are not only making valuable contributions to our aeronautics program they are an inspiration to others and are helping close the gender gap in the stem professions amelia earhart was a pioneering american hero as we celebrate her life let us honor her legacy by continuing to break barriers of possibility on earth and in the sky this post is part of a series produced by the huffington post to commemorate the 79th anniversary of amelia earharts 1935 recordbreaking solo flight when she became the first person ever to fly from the mainland united states to hawaii to see all the posts in the series click here

worldnews the bombing was long leisurely and merciless and so we return to the korean war when north korea was carpetbombed to the edge of existence the american media doesnt have a memory that stretches quite so far back at least not under present circumstances one commentator at msnbc recently explained for instance that the tiny pariah nation has been preparing for war for 63 years that would be since uh 1954 the year after the war ended but the war wasnt mentioned it never is doing so would disrupt the consensus attitude that kim jongun is a nucleararmed crazy and that north koreas hatred of the united states is just hatred dark and bitter the kind of rancor youd expect from a communist dictatorship and certified member of the axis of evil and now donald trump is taunting the crazy guy disrupting the usmaintained normalcy of global relations and putting this country at risk and thats almost always the focus not the use of nuclear weapons per se but the possibility that a north korean nuke could reach the united states as though american lives and national security mattered more than or were separate from the safety of the whole planet indeed the concept of national security justifies pretty much every action however destructive and horrifically consequential in the long term the concept justifies armed shortsightedness which equals militarism apparently protecting national security also means forgetting the korean war or never facing the reality of what we did to north korea from 1950 to 1953 but as trump plays war in his own special way the time to explore this media memory void is now i return to my opening quote which is from a twoyearold story in the washington post the bombing was long leisurely and merciless even by the assessment of americas own leaders over a period of three years or so we killed off what 20 percent of the population air force gen curtis lemay head of the strategic air command during the korean war told the office of air force history in 1984 dean rusk a supporter of the war and later secretary of state said the united states bombed everything that moved in north korea every brick standing on top of another after running low on urban targets us bombers destroyed hydroelectric and irrigation dams in the later stages of the war flooding farmland and destroying crops specifically the us dropped 635000 tons of explosives on north korea including 32557 tons of napalm an incendiary liquid that can clear forested areas and cause devastating burns to human skin tom oconnor wrote recently in newsweek this is more bomb tonnage than the us dropped in the pacific theater during world war ii he quoted historian bruce cumings most americans are completely unaware that we destroyed more cities in the north then we did in japan or germany during world war ii and so we start to open the wound of this war in which possibly as many as 3 million north koreans died a number that would have been even higher had gen douglas macarthur gotten his way he proposed nuclear holocaust in the name of national security figuring he could win the war in 10 days between 30 and 50 atomic bombs would have more than done the job he said in an interview shortly after the end of the war dropped under cover of darkness they would have destroyed the enemys air force on the ground wiped out his maintenance and his airmen for the americans strategic bombing made perfect sense giving advantage to american technological prowess against the enemys numerical superiority historian charles k armstrong wrote for the asia pacific journal but for the north koreans living in fear of b29 attacks for nearly three years including the possibility of atomic bombs the american air war left a deep and lasting impression the democratic peoples republic of korea government never forgot the lesson of north koreas vulnerability to american air attack and for half a century after the armistice continued to strengthen antiaircraft defenses build underground installations and eventually develop nuclear weapons to ensure that north korea would not find itself in such a position again the longterm psychological effect of the war on the whole of north korean society cannot be overestimated why is this reality not part of the current news in what way is american safety furthered by such willful ignorance cumings writing recently in the nation noted that he participated in a forum about north korea in seoul last fall with strobe talbott deputy secretary of state in the bill clinton administration at one point cumings brought up robert mcnamaras comment in the documentary the fog of war regarding vietnam that we never put ourselves in the shoes of the enemy and attempted to see the world as they did shouldnt this apply to our negotiations with north korea talbott cumings wrote then blurted its a grotesque regime there you have it its our numberone problem but so grotesque that theres no point trying to understand pyongyangs point of view or even that it might have some valid concerns we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism

politics a federal appeals court on wednesday overturned a lower court ruling and said georgias restrictive 2019 abortion law could take effect immediately the decision wasnt surprising after the us supreme court last month ruled that there is no constitutional right to an abortion the georgia law bans most abortions once a detectable human heartbeat is present cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy before many women realize theyre pregnant the georgia law includes exceptions for rape and incest as long as a police report is filed it also provides for later abortions when the mothers life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable a threejudge panel of the 11th us circuit court of appeals said that a us supreme court ruling in a mississippi case that overturned roe v wade clears the way for the law to take effect saying it makes clear no right to abortion exists under the constitution so georgia may prohibit them the appeals court also rejected arguments that a personhood provision in the law is unconstitutionally vague the provision grants personhood to a fetus giving it the same legal rights as people have after birth generally the courts ruling wouldnt take effect for several weeks until an official mandate was issued but the court issued a second order wednesday that allowed the law to take effect immediately a federal judge put the law on hold before it could take effect and in july 2020 permanently blocked it saying it was unconstitutional under the supreme court precedent that was recently overturned the state appealed to the 11th circuit and a threejudge panel of the appeals court last fall said it would wait for the supreme court ruling in the mississippi case before taking action on georgias appeal we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again the supreme court ruled on june 24 and georgias attorney general asked the appeals court that afternoon to overturn the lower court ruling and allow the states abortion law to take effect the 1973 decision of roe v wade declared a fundamental right to an abortion prior to viability of the fetus planned parenthood v casey narrowed that in 1992 to say states cant place an undue burden in the way of women seeking an abortion prior to viability georgias socalled heartbeat law was one of a wave of laws passed by republicancontrolled legislatures in recent years to attack those rulings as antiabortion activists and lawmakers saw an opportunity in a new conservative supreme court majority
social on the louisiana department of education ldoe website there is a curious link for parent petition in 2012 louisiana enacted the parent petition law in la rs 17105 to enable parents to transfer their childrens consistently lowperforming school to the recovery school district to be transformed into a charter school the recovery school district rsd is a statewide school district under the louisiana department of education that works with charter operators to transform academically struggling schools into highperforming charter schools the recovery school district currently oversees charter schools in orleans east baton rouge and caddo parishes for a school to be eligible to be transformed into an rsd charter school through the parent petition process the school must have received a letter grade of d or f for the past three consecutive years 2014 letter grade 2015 letter grade 2016 letter grade please click below for more information on the process including the list of eligible schools the official parent petition form faqs and a timeline of important deadlines 20162017 parent petition eligible schools the above arrangement is a form of parent trigger legislation one that supposedly allows parents to assume control in the restructuring of a failing school the american legislative exchange council alec promotes its parent trigger act as model legislation based on the idea of parent revolution leader ben austin though parent revolution is known for implanting its own people into locales in order to create a pseudograssroots revolution austins parent trigger idea has pretty much been a corporate reform flop click here for background on austin alec and parent trigger austin left parent revolution in 2014 which is about the time that google searches of that parent trigger revolutionnotsomuch go quiet until september 2017 when austin reappears as leader of a new nonprofit gig what is interesting in the ldoe parent petition description above is that the only option it allows parents is to hand a school over to the staterun recovery school district rsd for the purpose of converting the school to a charter school ldoe offers no option for the school to remain a traditional public school however the referenced legislation la rs 17105 does not automatically equate parentinitiated state takeover with the school in questions becoming a charter school from the original legislation la rs 17105 a failed school shall be reorganized as necessary and operated by the recovery school district pursuant to its authority in whatever manner is determined by the administering agency of the recovery school district to be most likely to bring the school to an acceptable level of performance as determined pursuant to the accountability plan according to the legislation above rsd could decide to convert the school into a charter however it seems that the intent of the legislation is that the state consider what is the best course of action on a casebycase basis in communicating their socalled la rs 17105 school takeover empowerment to parents ldoe shadily restricts all possible outcomes to one alone rsd charter school on october 05 2017 i submitted a public records request to ldoe for information about usage of louisianas parent petition as per louisiana public records statutes please provide copies of parent petition forms filed from 2012 to present for the purpose of converting low performing schools into rsd charters as per the parent petition law in la rs 17105 and as advertised on the lde website at httpwwwlouisianabelievescomschoolsparentpetition a comprehensive list of the names of such low performing schools that have been converted to rsd charter schools as a result of the abovenamed parent petition process below is the response i received on october 06 2017 as a post script let me add a note of irony staterun stateproclaimed solution rsd also includes a number of schools that qualify as failing based upon the criteria for failing as outlined in the parent petition a letter grade of d or f for the past three consecutive years 2014 letter grade 2015 letter grade 2016 letter grade from ldoes school performance score summary 20132016 rsd school name school grades for 2016 2015 and 2014 renew accelerated high school west bank f f f kenilworth science and technology charter school d d

schools from east baton rouge 8 schools caddo 2 schools st helena 1 school and pointe coupe 1 school as per 2016 legislation rsd new orleans schools which are now all charter schools are headed back to the orleans parish school board opsb sort of opsb does not exercise the same control over charters as it does over the four traditional directrun schools by july 1 2019 final transfer of all rsd schools to their local school boards must be completed if there is no longer an rsd there is no need for a parent petition however given that no parent elected to use the parent petition there is already no need for it staterun rsd schools that themselves qualified as failing and therefore are eligible to be taken over by the state that already is overseeing them will be allowed to quietly transfer back to original districts thus allowing the state that failed them to be let off of the hook another instance of the osteoporotic nature of corporate reform originally posted 100617 at

economy after she was furloughed from her job at a tennessee valley authority nuclear plant three weeks ago toni burned through her savings stocking up on essentials propane toilet paper shampoo and food the 38yearold single mother had her two high schoolers and her 20yearold daughter home from college to care for and they needed enough to survive on as the novel coronavirus pandemic wreaked havoc across the country and brought the economy screeching to a stop she filed for unemployment almost immediately but weeks later the check hasnt come and the bills keep mounting across the country utilities and states have enacted policies to stop service shutoffs for nonpayment as an employee of the federally owned power company that generates nearly all of tennessees electricity she figured the utilities that distribute that energy would follow suit last week she called the dayton electric department the municipal power distributor in her small town in central tennessee to let them know shed be late on her bill the response was unsparing she told huffpost on friday evening they basically told me theyll give me five extra days and id accrue late fees and if i couldnt pay it theyd have to run it off said toni who asked to keep her last name private for fear of drawing unwanted attention to her daughters they said if they let everyone not pay theyd be losing money and it wasnt their problem if she doesnt come up with 236 plus 26 in late fees the utility said her power would be shut off monday it would have been friday but the city government was closed for good friday if her unemployment check doesnt come saturday and she cant muster the cash the cost of getting the power back on will go up more with the 65 reconnection fee the total bill will come to 327 im hoping and praying my unemployment comes in tomorrow she said friday its really stressful im not going to lie it doesnt make you sleep good at night knowing that in a few days your kids are going to have the power off dayton electric did not return a call friday requesting comment this is the stark reality for many americans particularly those in rural parts of the south whose utility providers operate outside the bounds of the state regulatory orders and corporate pledges to keep the power and heat on during a pandemic that requires anyone who can to stay home in the southeast particularly in tennessee the electrical system dates back to the early 20th century when the new deal funded vast public power projects to electrify a poor region that private utilities unable to turn a profit simply left in the dark in an ironic historical twist that system now leaves millions at the mercy of smalltown nickelanddimers like many states the tennessee public utility commission directed power companies to stop disconnecting service to households that couldnt afford their bills as the pandemic induced a wave of layoffs that shattered weekly jobless claims records for the past three weeks in a row but its march 31 order applied to just three forprofit investorowned electric companies the vast majority of tennessee is served by a decentralized network of public power providers that exists outside the states authority thats why toni is days from losing power even as friends in a neighboring town can check electricity off their list of concerns as bills stack up and savings dwindle adding to the complexity is the fact that in both cases the tva generates the actual electricity the utilities are selling on march 26 the tva extended a 1 billion credit line to local power companies it also deferred payments in hopes of granting regulatory flexibility to allow local power companies to halt disconnection of electric service the strength of public power is a passionate commitment to serve people over balance sheets jeff lyash the tvas chief executive said in a statement this is perhaps more critical today than it has ever been where theres a scattered response you see some utilities implementing these policies and others telling customers and members they cant make exceptions in hard times or itd encourage some to abuse the system seeking firmer assurances advocates urged the tennessee valley public power association the consortium that represents the tvas local distributors to call for a blanket moratorium on shutoffs but the group refused claiming it would be intruding on local control to issue such a recommendation said bri knisley the tennessee coordinator at appalachian voices a regional environmental and antipoverty nonprofit when the utilities use the cover of local control without actually giving the public local control you end up with a situation like this knisley said by phone friday where theres a scattered response you see some utilities implementing these policies and others telling customers and members they cant make exceptions in hard times or itd encourage some to abuse the system deflated knisley turned to the governor on wednesday more than two dozen nonprofits including appalachian voices and local chapters of the naacp and the sierra club wrote a letter to tennessee gov bill lee r asking him to put the full weight of your administration behind protecting the publics health and safety during this time of crisis and issue a statewide moratorium on all utility shutoffs by taking the measures above to halt utility service shut offs and fees you can address some of the burdens that are affecting the lives of everyday tennesseans the most the letter said now more than ever residents and businesses across the state need to know they will get the immediate assistance they require such a move has precedent in mississippi the state attorney general stepped in to expand the public service commissions powers to cover utilities not ordinarily within its regulatory jurisdiction in north carolina the governor issued a similar order to cover the 26 rural electric coops that fell outside the state utilities commissions march 19 ban on shutoffs but on thursday lees office told knisley it was receiving hundreds of advocacy letters so its probably not reasonable for us to expect a response a spokesperson for the administration did not respond to a request for comment on friday evening nearly half the state meanwhile remains subject to disconnections according to a map the knoxville news sentinel has kept updated on its website its difficult to know just how many americans are struggling without electricity or heating right now there is scant national survey data in 2015 the last year the federal energy information administration polled residential energy consumers 1 in 3 us households reported struggling to keep up with electricity and heating bills when the census bureau conducted the department of housing and urban developments most recent american housing survey in 2017 it found more than 184 million us households roughly 15 of the population received notices threatening to terminate utility service for nonpayment in the first three months of that year of those 12 million households service was shut off though most investorowned utilities had vowed to stop disconnecting service few agreed to reconnect households who lost power before the moratoriums took effect in northeast ohio for example the investorowned giant firstenergy corp left hundreds of households without electricity weeks after it pledged to stop shutoffs huffpost reported last month house democrats proposed a nationwide moratorium on utility shutoffs last month as part of the 22 trillion stimulus bill that passed but the provision was stripped from the senate version sens ed markey dmass elizabeth warren dmass and kamala harris dcalif proposed legislation that could be included in the next aid package congress considers but in rural towns like dayton draconian policies on utility shutoffs come with an added sting people are charitable with their neighbors we live in a small country town footballs big softballs big were not overrun by meth or anything we dont have a lot of drugs or crime in our area toni said we have a lot of people who help each other out until she was furloughed toni said she donated 30 a month of her paycheck to helping hands of dayton a nonprofit that provides services to those in need she never thought of herself as someone whod need it but even there the policies to help with utility bills require applications that take weeks for approval on thursday toni was scrambling to buy herself more time she offered to pay dayton electric her last 100 hoping she could pay down some of the bill and make the rest up later with her unemployment or federal stimulus check whichever one came first the utility she said balked at the offer they labeled me as like youre one of the ones waiting on a stimulus check she said i said no i work for tva power were furloughed i dont receive any assistance and im a single mom i work i own a home its not just people who are low income she sighed when the country closes down its hard youre no different than nobody else and look if im struggling im sure theres someone worse than me whos really struggling we should have compassion for one another update april 11 toni told huffpost that readers who contacted her on saturday after this story was published have donated enough money to cover her bill we remain committed

politics president joe biden on wednesday unveiled a series of new executive actions to confront the mounting effects of global climate change following another stalled legislative push from the president and senate democrats to secure billions of dollars in climate and clean energy investments biden detailed the unilateral effort during a visit to the shuttered brayton point coalfired power plant in somerset massachusetts the facility is now being transformed into a manufacturing hub for submarine cables that will be used on offshore wind farms now being developed off the east coast biden called planetary warming a clear and present danger and said he has a responsibility to act with urgency and resolve let me be clear climate change is an emergency he said in the coming weeks im going to use the power i have as president to turn these words into formal official government actions through the appropriate proclamations executive orders and regulatory power that a president possesses when it comes to fighting climate change i will not take no for an answer the executive push includes actions to further advance the already rapidly growing us offshore wind industry as well as better safeguard communities affected by extreme heat but it falls far short of a national emergency declaration or the beast mode executive action that progressive lawmakers and climate hawks have demanded in recent days our focus is on what we can do in light of where we find ourselves between the urgency of action and the clarity of opportunity thats in front of us a senior white house official said during a press call ahead of bidens speech the interior department for the first time will propose establishing a pair of offshore wind areas in the gulf of mexico encompassing some 700000 acres off the coasts of texas and louisiana biden also directed the interior department to advance offshore wind off the mid and southern atlantic coast as well as and floridas gulf coast biden also announced 23 billion in funding for femas building resilient infrastructure and communities bric program to help communities confront a myriad of climate impacts from extreme heat and drought to flooding and wildfires those impacts have been on full display this week as punishing heat and wildfires plague swaths of the us and europe finally the department of health and human services will issue new guidance to help states leverage funding through the low income home energy assistance program liheap in order to build community cooling centers and purchase athome air conditioners last week sen joe manchin dwva ruled out any new climate spending in a scaleddown social spending package seemingly upending months of negotiations on capitol hill manchin subsequently said he was still open to a bigger deal that includes climate funding and that he just wanted to see julys inflation numbers first but public outrage had already ballooned climate and environmental advocates condemned the coal state democrat for negotiating in bad faith and urged biden to immediately use his executive powers including declaring a national climate emergency to curb planetwarming greenhouse gas emissions reporting earlier this week from the washington post and other media outlets indicated biden was considering even likely to sign an emergency declaration as soon as today but by tuesday the white house had at least temporarily sidelined the idea the climate emergency is not going to happen tomorrow but we still have it on the table karine jeanpierre the white house press secretary said during a tuesday briefing i dont have a date circled in the calendar in the 18 months since biden took office many climate activists environmental groups and progressive democrats have repeatedly called on the president to lean into his executive powers to confront the global threat including halting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and blocking new pipelines and other fossil fuel projects that pressure only grew after manchin torpedoed the climate talks on capitol hill last week democratic sens sheldon whitehouse ri and jeff merkley ore joined those calls urging biden to use the defense production act to boost clean energy technologies the potential to enact the legislation is dead merkley told reporters previously this then frees up the president to use the full powers of the executive branch and those full powers certainly include a climate emergency the white house has signaled that biden plans to take additional executive action on climate in the coming days and weeks bidens speech and the administrations announcements wednesday received mixed reviews from climate and environmental advocates many welcomed the executive actions but called on biden to go further to rein in planetwarming fossil fuels we appreciate that biden feels like the climate crisis is an emergency but now is the time for him to act like it jl andrepont a senior policy campaigner at environmental group 350org said in a statement the planet is burning droughts heatwaves and wildfires are contributing to famine and death on almost every continent while biden waits to officially

was and although mcripley cant be sure the medication pause is the reason her condition got worse she is sure about how the cost of her drugs affects her life even when shes able to take them its really upsetting because i have to ask for assistance for things like groceries mcripley said im asking my parents and i should be in a position where im helping them at this time not the other way around mcripleys story is by no means unusual or limited to people with ms high cost also appears to discourage medicare beneficiaries with cancer hepatitis c and certain immune disorders from taking their medications according to a major paper that appeared in the journal health affairs earlier this year and it wasnt the first study to document such effects democrats have been promising to help people like mcripley and they may be on the verge of fulfilling that promise with the inflation reduction act which party leaders hope to pass in the coming days and send to president joe biden for his signature the legislation includes several provisions designed to reduce what people pay at the pharmacy counter the bestknown and most controversial of these would give the federal government power to negotiate the prices of drugs that medicare covers which is something that the governments of other economically advanced countries already do and a big reason why pharmaceutical prices in those nations are so much lower than they are here but only a limited number of drugs would be subject to negotiation under a process that wouldnt lead to lower prices for those drugs until 2026 even then drug prices in the us would likely remain significantly higher than they are in peer countries which means that medicare beneficiaries like mcripley would still need more help ideally sooner rather than later and they may get it the other prescription drug reforms of the inflation reduction act have gotten a lot less attention but several could have a big impact including one that would put a hard limit on outofpocket drug expenses it would phase in over two years starting in 2024 so that by 2025 beneficiaries like mcripley would pay no more than 2000 a year for drugs that now cost them many times more than that mcripley said the provision could be a lifesaver which if the studies are correct is literally true but that all depends on the bill actually passing as of this writing that is still no sure thing the story of why medicare beneficiaries owe so much for prescriptions goes back to 2003 when president george w bush signed the law that created medicares drug benefit which is known as part d the program addressed a huge need prior to that medicare beneficiaries frequently couldnt find drug coverage but the programs chief architects were republicans and conservative democrats who refused to give the federal government leverage over drug prices and werent willing to spend what it would take to finance the kind of comprehensive benefit many seniors needed as a result part d has big gaps in its coverage exposing seniors to significant deductibles copayments and coinsurance the affordable care act which president barack obama signed in 2010 addressed the problem partly by gradually eliminating one of the big gaps in coverage or closing the doughnut hole as it had come to be known the 2018 bipartisan budget act which president donald trump signed accelerated the process these drugs arent optional for people these are what you need to extend your life or to prevent you from getting sicker but even with those reforms fully in place medicare beneficiaries remain responsible for a fraction of their drug costs with no limit on the total the portion is small just 5 once drug spending reaches a certain threshold but some drugs have such high list prices tens even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year that the 5 becomes punishing enough to deter patients from taking the drugs altogether i think there is this perception that just because someone is on medicare theyre covered and most of their prescription drug costs and other kinds of costs are covered said amy niles executive vice president of the pan foundation which provides financial assistance to people who cant afford their medical bills but when it comes to prescription medications thats not the case so for people on medicare there is no limit to what you might pay out of pocket for these medications the study that appeared in health affairs earlier this year shows just how severe the effects can be among medicare beneficiaries who werent eligible for extra government assistance nearly 1 in 3 were failing to fill the new prescriptions researchers found we know that these are critically important drugs many of them the firstline treatment recommendation vanderbilt associate professor and lead author stacie dusetzina told huffpost so these arent optional for people these are what you need to extend your life or to prevent you from getting sicker the fact that its nearly 1 in 3 that is just mindblowing not all drugs that medicare beneficiaries need translate to such high individual costs its mainly the drugs that individual beneficiaries purchase directly at pharmacies using their part d coverage infusions and other drugs they get at doctors offices and clinics usually fall under medicare part b which pays for outpatient services and the costsharing in part b is typically much lower because most beneficiaries have supplemental coverage or outofpocket limits on medical spending to illustrate the illogic of that distinction dusetzina has cited the example of breast cancer the treatment for one common type known as her2negative cancer is a drug that people take orally for medicare beneficiaries annual outofpocket costs can exceed 10000 the treatment for a different variant her2positive breast cancer is an infusion which for most medicare beneficiaries will cost a fraction of that amount it means you might be feeling lucky that you have a cancer thats treated with infusions instead of pills dusetzina said it makes no sense at all joan durnell powell doesnt need a study to tell her about the high cost of drugs and the choices it forces upon patients powell is a retiree in california who in 2014 got a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes a class of blood disorders the medications shes taken have kept her alive she said in an interview but with outofpocket costs that run into four and frequently five figures like many medicare beneficiaries powell has gotten help from several private charities including the pan foundation that assist people who cant afford their drugs if it wasnt for the support of these foundations i literally wouldnt be living but sometimes the grants expire or the paperwork doesnt get through powell said and even when the money is there it covers only some of the bills today she said she still has to come up with about 5000 to 6000 a year on a fixed annual income of less than 30000 anytime i tell people about this i say i dont have to worry about my disease i have to worry about my copay the limits on what the charities can provide are why those organizations have lined up with patients for affordable drugs familiesusa and other health care advocacy groups to support the proposed outofpocket cap they are equally enthusiastic about some related provisions in the democratic legislation including a proposed expansion of support for medicare beneficiaries with low incomes like all policy proposals the democratic legislation comes with some tradeoffs which in the case of the outofpocket cap and the lowincome assistance is primarily in the form of new government spending in other words the reason medicare beneficiaries like mcripley and powell would soon pay less for their drugs under the democratic proposal is that the federal government would be assuming more of the financial burden directly that helps explain why those two provisions are part of the same bill that calls for government negotiation of drug prices the negotiation and some related provisions of the legislation would reduce medicare spending because as the prices of individual drugs came down medicare wouldnt have to lay out as much money for them i dont have to worry about my disease i have to worry about my copay the drug industry and its allies including republicans and some democrats have warned that forcing down drug prices would reduce drug company profits making it harder for them to attract the investment capital they need to finance the research and development of new drugs potentially that could mean fewer breakthrough drugs as in the kind that now treat mcripleys ms and powells blood disorder but analysts at the congressional budget office have said they think the democratic bill would likely have only a small effect on innovation and while plenty of researchers think the effects could be larger dusetzina is among a large group that thinks the cbo got it right i think the bill does a nice job of finding a balance putting in guardrails around what drugs are eligible for negotiation and also targeting only a small number of drugs to start dusetzina said so the pharma industrys claims related to the loss of cures i think are dramatically overstated we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased

reduction act doesnt get through congress and though all 50 senators in the democratic caucus have now said they support the bill clearing the way for passage the drug industry is making one last desperate push to break up the coalition a lot is riding on the outcome for some medicare beneficiaries it might even be a matter of life or death

worldnews saudi arabias longawaited lifting of a ban on womens driving widely viewed as a symbol of saudi misogyny will likely serve as a litmus test for crown prince mohammed bin salmans ability to introduce economic and social reforms despite conservative opposition it also distracts attention from international criticism of the kingdoms war in yemen and charges by human rights groups as well as some muslim leaders that the kingdom is fostering sectarianism and prejudice against nonmuslims if last weeks national day celebrations in which women were for the first time allowed to enter a stadium is anything to go by opposition is likely to be limited to protests on social media to be sure thousands welcomed the move as well as the lifting of the ban and saudi media reported that senior islamic scholars who for decades opposed expanding womens rights and some of whom criticized prince mohammeds effort to expand entertainment opportunities in the kingdom said that they saw no religious objection to womens driving conservatives made their rejection of enhancing womens rights in response to the national day celebrations patriotism does not mean sin of course what is happening does not please god and his prophet patriotism is not dancing free mixing losing decency and playing music what strange times said one critic on twitter a video of a man telling celebrating crowds that they have no shame no religion no tribe was widely shared on social media hundreds of thousands used an arabic hashtag demanding the restoration of powers to the kingdoms religious police whose ability to strictly enforce ultraconservative sunni muslim moral codes was curbed last year a 24yearold speaking earlier this year to the guardian noted that ultraconservatism maintains a hold on significant numbers of young people you know that the top 11 twitter handles here are salafi clerics right we are talking more than 20 million people who hang on their every word they will not accept this sort of change never the youth said talal salama a saudi singer was attacked on social media this week for singing a text from the quran during the national day celebrations the disaster is not just that he is sitting singing the quran the disaster is that it was a party approved by the government that is allowing him to sing said lawyer musleh aludayni on twitter in advance of the lifting of the ban saudi authorities banned saad alhijri head of fatwas religious legal opinions in the asir governorate from preaching for declaring that women should not drive because their brains shrink to a quarter the size of a mans when they go shopping the suspension was the latest measure in a crackdown in which scores of islamic scholars including some of the kingdoms most popular ones judges and intellectuals were arrested the arrested were likely to ensure that conservative opposition to the lifting of the ban would be muted the kingdoms decision to delay implementation of the decision until june next year gives the government time to neutralize opposition and serves as an indication of what it would take to ensure saudi womens rights to implement the decision saudi arabia has to first eliminate bureaucratic legal and social hurdles that prevent women from obtaining licenses create facilities for women to learn how to drive and train policemen to interact with female drivers in a country that enforces gender segregation and in which men largely interact only with female relatives the lifting of the ban is part of prince mohammeds vision 2030 plan that seeks to diversify and streamline the economy and introduce limited social reform but avoid political liberalization with women accounting for half of the saudi population and more than half of its university graduates vision 2030 indicates the limits on granting womens rights by envisioning that women will account for only 30 percent of a reformed kingdoms workforce while the lifting of the ban in a decree by king salman allows women to apply for a license without the permission of their male guardian the principle of male guardianship that subjects women to the will of their menfolk remains in place there is moreover for example no indication that last weeks use of a stadium as a test case will lead to a lifting of restrictions on womens sporting rights including free access to attend mens competitions and the ability to practice and compete in a majority of sports disciplines that are not mentioned in the quran the public relations value of the lifting of the ban was evident in the fact that it temporarily drew attention away from news that reflected badly on the kingdom including mounting international criticism of saudi conduct of its war in yemen that has pushed the country to the edge of the abyss saudi arabia has desperately been seeking to avert censorship by the united nations and defeat calls for an independent investigation it also put on the news backburner a 62page report by human rights watch that despite the banning of mr alhijri documented that that saudi arabia has permitted governmentappointed religious scholars and clerics to refer to religious minorities in derogatory terms or demonize them in official documents and religious rulings that influence government decisionmaking antishia antisufi antichristian and antijewish sentiment was evident in the saudi education system and in the judiciary the report published on tuesday said saudi arabia adheres to a puritan interpretation of islam that views shiite muslims as heretics and advocates avoidance by muslims of nonmuslims the kingdom has spent an estimated 100 billion in the last four decades to propagate its austere vision of islam in a bid to establish itself as the leader of the muslim world and to counter the revolutionary appeal of iran following the 1979 islamic revolution that toppled a monarch and an icon of us influence in the middle east in doing so it has contributed to muslim societies like malaysia and indonesia becoming more conservative and intolerant towards minorities saudi ultraconservative influence was visible earlier this week when an owner of a selfservice launderette in the malaysian state of johor banned nonmuslims from using his services we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves

politics a new book claims that former president donald trump verbalized his disdain for wounded veterans early on in his presidency the authors of the divider trump in the white house 20172021 the new york times peter baker and the new yorkers susan b glasser detailed an exchange trump had with his thenchief of staff john kelly in which the former president expressed interest in copying the grandeur he witnessed during a french military parade he just wanted to make one key tweak according to an excerpt published by the new yorker in 2017 trump flew to paris for bastille day celebrations held by emmanuel macron the thennew french president the celebration was also meant to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the american entrance into the wwi due to this macron apparently wanted to appeal to trumps love for opulence with a grandiose military display which included vintage tanks rolling down the champslysees as fighter jets flew overhead when trump returned to washington dc he asked his generals to throw him an even showier military parade for july 4 part of his vision for improving on frances spectacular martial display was apparently by barring veterans who were wounded or used a wheelchair from his parade look i dont want any wounded guys in the parade trump allegedly told kelly noting with distaste that visibly injured veterans were featured in the french parade this doesnt look good for me kelly a retired marine corps general was apparently flabbergasted by the idea those are the heroes kelly told trump according to the book in our society theres only one group of people who are more heroic than they are and they are buried over in arlington the book noted that kelly did not mention that his son robert a lieutenant killed in action in afghanistan was among those buried in arlington national cemetery in virginia i dont want them trump apparently repeated it doesnt look good for me trump who dodged the vietnam war draft has a history of disrespecting veterans especially those who have died or have been injured in 2020 the atlantic reported that trump referred to american service members who died in wwi as losers and suckers in conversations with his senior staff during a trip to france in 2018 while on the trip he turned down a planned visit to the aisnemarne american cemetery a wwi cemetery in belleau france near the site of the battle of belleau wood his reason was reportedly because the cemetery was filled with losers in another conversation during the trip he referred to the more than 1800 marines who lost their lives at belleau wood as suckers for getting killed the atlantic reported former white house spokesperson alyssa farah told huffpost at the time that the atlantics report was false president trump holds the military in the highest regard hes demonstrated his commitment to them at every turn delivering on his promise to give our troops a much needed pay raise increasing military spending signing critical veterans reforms and supporting military spouses farah said trump also famously criticized the late sen john mccain who was held for over five years as a prisoner of war in vietnam hes not a war hero trump said in 2015 of mccain i like people who werent captured
social its a warm spring evening in central park and a group of teens are gathered at the alice in wonderland statue just up from the boating lake for most of them frolicking on the iconic statue is probably something they havent done in a while but today the teens dont hold back theyre scaling the slippery toadstools patting the white rabbits ears and vying to perch like buddhas on the mad hatters top hat they are their kid selves again the buoyant mood is because this crew of homeschooled teenagers ranging in age for 11 to 18 is celebrating the fact that just under two weeks ago they did something quite remarkable in an offbroadway theater on 43rd street they staged a production of alices adventures of wonderland in a sold out weekend run the show was entirely teendirected acted and produced parents and other adult friends played an important supportive role but for the most part everything from the lighting to props the stage managing to ticket sales the choreography to the character development was done by this group of new york teens its fitting that the cast and crew are now capering like sevenyear olds on the statue for me alice is not about madness its about childhood and dreams says fifteen year old leo lion as he looks on leo founded firebird youth theater three years ago and has directed all three of the companys shows including alice i wanted the show to capture the imagination of childhood just like lewis carroll captured it in the book with its simple yet whimsical props and costumes and its clever playful staging firebirds production of alice did indeed capture the childhood wonder of wonderland when alice played with a delightful mix of innocence and fearlessness by twelveyear old leigh stern fell down the rabbit hole her descent was staged sideways on from the audiences point of view alice sat on a stage box flailing her legs and arms framed by a hulahoop decked out in foliage as she considered aloud whether she might fall right through the earth a big disc painted with a hypnotic spiral spun behind her and two cast members paced up and down on either side holding shelves with books and teacups altogether the scene skillfully suggested the dreamy bizarre and dizzying fall into wonderland but also the wondrous way that children perhaps playing in a park might stage the famous fall fifteenyear old director leo lion photo katherine bourbeau alice has always been one of leos favorite books and honoring the lewis carroll original was very important to him leo adapted the story with the companys sixteenyear old stage manager thomas pflanz they produced a script that stays very close to the book not just in the characters and scenes but also in the language according to leo disney derivatives of alice and even avantgarde stage versions tend to overlook the beautiful writing and especially the funny and clever dialogue the props sets and costuming in the show were similarly loyal to the original leigh and her mother irene stern worked together to produce an alice dress that was an almost replica of the dress drawn by john tenniel in the original illustrations the mad hatters tea party was also staged in a way that is deeply reminiscent of tenniels drawing of the same scene with the mad hatter dormouse and march hare sitting in a line beside the bemused and unimpressed alice and when eighteenyear old sydney harris began creating the showstopping dodo puppet she returned to the original book i wanted to capture the huge rotund shape of tenniels dodo bird sydney also composed the music for the show and was delighted to find that carrolls poems translated easily into song his poems have a distinct rhythm and they stick to it sydney researched traditional music used in the 18th and 19th centuries for quadrille dancing and then produced the lobster quadrille a highlight of the show that was sung and danced by pj lodin 15 as the desolate yet hilariously divalike mock turtle and alioune fall 15 as the cheeky cockney griffin research was a big part of the process not only for the scriptwriters and the creative team the cast put time into researching their characters pj discovered that mock turtle soup was turtle soup made with beef when funds were short for pj this connected to the way that everything about the mock turtle and his stories is just a bit off other actors did research outside of the text too my own eleven year old son benny rendell looked into stories and pictures of prince albert alive during carrolls lifetime to embellish his character a dotty yet slightly sinister king of hearts fourteenyear old emily mondrus who played a perfectly panicked white rabbit turned to harpo marx who she felt offered something rabbitlike that she could bring to her role emily also discovered something about herself during the show i became a rabbit she recalls for the first time ever i wasnt conscious of being on the stage i wasnt thinking about what people would say about me i was simply the white rabbit even though this wasnt a professional or adultled production emily achieved something that even the most seasoned actors hope for and work toward being present and real in their fictional role i asked some of the cast and crew how alice compared to other shows theyd done jeremiah burch who played a deliciously dormant dormouse has been in a number of tv shows films and professional productions leo has been doing this a while now and hes very professional so we all respect him and he respects us it seems most of the cast and crew agreed that even though they were taking direction from a fifteen year old and being stage managed by a sixteen year old it felt no different from more standard adultled productions in fact sometimes it was better leigh felt that the teen environment gave her room to really explore being alice and she felt comfortable making suggestions and having her own voice heard fourteen year old isabelle pflanz who played a fearsome queen of hearts and a hilarious semicomatose frog said that in firebird productions everyone gets much more of a say and we bond much more to the show bonding is a word that comes up again and again as i talk to the cast and crew while the spring sun begins to set over central park destiny vega a stagehand for the show who is eighteen years old talks about the company becoming one big family over the course of the production we had our arguments our laughter and our cries but we bonded really tightly destinys fellow stagehand sixteenyear old daniel zuzworsky enjoyed the camaraderie too and said the production allowed him to really connect with old and new friends alike firebirds resident comic pj lodin was the only one not to talk about the connections formed during the show indeed he claimed that because the cast are a group of freakish undersocialized homeschoolers who are fearful of going outside or making friends the whole show was done using avatars while each cast member was plugged into a giant technovat in their own homes pj also claimed that director leo gained the respect of his peers by wrestling to death a giant bear bears avatars and jokes aside pj raises a good point about stereotypes and expectations leo describes how he often faces a healthy dose of underestimation when he tells people what he and firebird youth theater are doing together people say homeschoolers are afraid to do anything social or that teens in general cant get something done eighteenyear old sara margolis also points out sara is the oldest member of the ensemble who played a number of characters and did some incredible acrobatics during the shows imaginative croquet sequence but we did it she adds with a grin we put on a show a really great offbroadway show the sun has gone and the teens are sitting on a wall overlooking the statue which has now turned to shadows theyve moved on from talking about alice theyre discussing what will be next no final decision is made by the time everyone leaves the park but the cast and crew unanimously agrees there will be another firebird show soon
economy the organizing campaign at starbucks has succeeded in unionizing nearly 20 of the coffee chains us stores so far a historic breakthrough for the labor movement but the union effort is now in the early stages of an even heavier lift negotiating a first contract starbucks has every incentive not to offer the workers a satisfactory deal since that would only encourage more workers to organize from the perspective of the union workers united securing solid gains in a collective bargaining agreement could turbocharge an already hot organizing drive and bring many more of starbucks 9000 corporateowned us stores into the fold both sides are now girding for whats likely to be a bruising fight at the negotiating table one that could ultimately determine the future of unions inside starbucks developing a contract that meets or exceeds what we already offer to our partners is going to be difficult for them to do predicted reggie borges a starbucks spokesperson these contracts dont start at the baseline of the benefits that our partners get that is the fullstop rule the contract negotiations start at zero after this story ran borges said he misspoke about contract talks starting at zero he said he meant to convey that collective bargaining involves lots of variables and nobody can predict the outcome starbucks has already hinted at some of the hardball tactics that might lay ahead ceo howard schultz suggested in a recent company forum that starbucks could roll out new benefits that would apply everywhere but the unionized locations since those stores are now negotiating their own work terms people who might be voting for a union dont really understand schultz said according to the wall street journal starbucks has every incentive not to offer the workers a satisfactory deal since that would only encourage more workers to organize one of the challenges for the union is consolidating its leverage against the company the campaign known as starbucks workers united has been organizing the chain store by store filing for elections at locations where union support is high the company has pushed for larger elections that would encompass an entire market like buffalo new york which is home to the first store to unionize but the national labor relations board has rejected that argument and sided with the union the unions storebystore strategy is vastly more manageable than trying to unionize starbucks nationally or market by market but it technically leaves the union negotiating a contract for every store that joins michelle eisen a union leader and barista at the first store to unionize said the campaign views each starbucks as distinct and that applying the same exact contract to every outpost would go against what we said weve wanted from the beginning eisen said the union hopes to achieve what might be called a national framework for a union contract one that includes basic guarantees across union starbucks stores but allows individual shops to address their own concerns there are aspects of the company that are consistent in these stores but there are a lot of aspects that are not she said eisen said she works at a small walkin location known as a cafe in company parlance and that her store operates differently from a drivethru store like the one in mesa arizona that recently unionized some contract language for one might not make sense for the other we have to find the elements of stores that are consistent and that becomes a national framework but allowing for fluidity within the contracts that can cater to each individual store as well eisen said starbucks borges said the company has no interest in hammering out national standards of any kind no matter how many stores decide to unionize from our perspective the law and the nlrb granted the union their argument that each individual store is its own unit borges said so now we move forward with individual contracts for each of those stores securing a first contract can be notoriously difficult in the us in part because employers face no meaningful penalties for dragging out the process its a common strategy for companies to bargain in bad faith and make no real progress at the table in hopes union support will dwindle over time and perhaps the union will even be decertified or purged from the workplace if only a handful of stores ultimately unionize it would be easier for starbucks to stifle the campaign but the union has filed for elections at more than 200 stores and so far they have lost only two of the more than 20 vote counts that have already occurred the results have not been certified for some of them at this pace the union is likely to gain more leverage at the bargaining table and more public support its clear that this is a very workerled organizing drive and the workers are in extremely good communication with each other said rebecca givan an associate professor of labor studies at rutgers university so we know that the workers that are already at the bargaining table at one store are going to try to get a broad understanding of what the workers everywhere want as they establish their demands borges assured the company would bargain in good faith were going to be respectful were going to honor the process but achieving a contract could realistically take years and will ultimately depend on the companys willingness to reach one its clear that this is a very workerled organizing drive and the workers are in extremely good communication with each other starbucks has deployed dozens of lawyers from the unionavoidance law firm littler mendelson to slow the pace of union elections and has dispatched starbucks managers to persuade workers to vote against the union but givan said fighting a union effort at each store becomes less tenable as the campaign grows it will be hard to maintain that strategy at potentially dozens of bargaining tables especially when workers are fully aligned and in coordination with each other she said starbucks has also fired a number of known union supporters the company maintains that these terminations were all for legitimate reasons but labor board officials have already determined that seven firings in memphis were in response to union activism and therefore illegal bloomberg recently reported that the labor board will pursue a case against starbucks if it doesnt agree to a settlement as workers speak out about the companys handling of the union campaign starbucks could face a backlash from consumers that affects its bottom line the stakes could be even higher in an ugly contract fight if the union enlists laborfriendly politicians and other highprofile supporters willing to criticize the company sharon block a labor law professor at harvard university and former official in the biden white house said the brand dynamic is hard to quantify but reputable considerations must figure into starbucks calculus i imagine it weighs on their decisionmaking she said it isnt just about doing the financial math if workers can successfully organize hundreds of stores there may be a point in which starbucks finds it in the companys interest to acknowledge itself as a union employer and bargain accordingly rather than continue to wage a battle at every store where a union petition pops up we remain committed to providing

how much organizing it would take to get there she said unionizing a single store takes much longer than one might expect she believes public support for the campaign might matter more in the end than how many stores wind up in the unions column we get stronger obviously with every petition thats filed and every store that wins she said the hope is that if the company is really who theyve professed to be for the last 50 years that theres still room for them to make changes and get onboard and become the corporation that truly is progressive and leads by example
social the year was 1965 it was a warm fall day and i was driving paul goodman the noted thinker and prominent social theorist to his hotel he was to be a guest speaker at a program i had created for area high school students to dialogue with prominent writers artists and politicians this was the paul goodman playwright poet philosopher psychotherapist and anarchist the writer once called a thoreau for the 20th century i was in awe of the man he was my idol i had devoured his works and taken many of his ideas to heart they had been the primary inspiration for my present and future callingtransforming a moribund and nonresponsive educational system into something more humane on the wall of my study i had posted his words as a personal challenge the notion that nothing can be done is completely unsatisfactory to me something must be done and here i was alone in the car with the man himself i was thrilled to have his full attention after a few minutes of awkward chitchat i cut to the chase with a question i had been dying to ask mr goodman you are one of the best known thinkers in the country your criticism cuts to the very heart of the hypocrisies of our culture but why dont you lay out some practical alternatives and work to make them happen we need to build new models so that people can see those ideas in action to realize their possibilities at which point he tamped down his pipe turned to me and said thats not what i do it was a pivotal moment in my life and a challenge i felt compelled to take up accordingly the focus of my lifes work has been on blending theory and practice thats just what i do and who i am and this is a clarion call to unearth and encourage similar kindred spirits today towards that end i offer the first of several past efforts in the hope that they will prove of interest to others they are set not in concrete but in silly putty not to be replicated but challenged and reshaped from the perspective of the present employing the technology of 2015 and the talents and skillsets of those who take them on so lets dig in beginning with the program which paul goodman attended between 1964 and 1968 yale law school was the scene of a truly extraordinary happening each spring and fall large assemblies of high school students from the greater new haven area filled all 600 seats of the law school auditorium to hear major thinkers discuss and debate contemporary controversial issues after which they repaired to classrooms to discuss those issues among themselves in workshops led by yale undergraduates supplemented with reading material provided in advance plus a suggested reading list for those who wished to delve further over five years we held 54 such saturday programs numerous specials and also one summer program attendance totaled between 1520000 there was no charge for the program it was called perspectives the purpose of the program was to encourage and sustain an interest among young people in the issues confronting a free society by exposing them to a variety of perspectives through lectures reading debate and discussion our goal was the development of an analytic and questioning spirit elevation of their social political and artistic literacy topics included dialogues on race from a legal and historical perspective its psychological and moral dimensions and on being black then called negro in america censorship sexual morality the cold war anticommunism as policy the limits of protest and dissent morality ethics and foreign policy and the arms race we held one of the earliest if not the first teachins on vietnam there was also a program on the arts including the new american cinema jazz as an art form and special theatrical programs in conjunction with long wharf theater speakers were drawn from the faculty of yale and its law school as well as from across the nation it include such luminaries as reverend william sloan coffin jr c vann woodward eleanor holmes later eleanor holmes norton on being a negro in america then a law school student law school dean louis pollak professor alexander bickel ny times education editor fred hechinger aj muste head of the committee for nonviolent action armando chardiet castros former un ambassador dave dellinger editor of liberation floyd mckissick the national chairman of core julian bond then of the georgia state legislature percy sutton manhattan borough president linguist and social critic noam chomsky diplomat writer and educator conor cruise obrien vietnam war critic senator wayne morse and from the national review its publisher william rusher and contributors including l brent bozell ernest van den haag and jeffery st john a major festival of the black arts included the poet and playwright amiri baraka then known as le roy jones poet larry neil and actor ossie davis perspectives was my brainchild i was a high school teacher and chairman of the history department of a local high school at the time i had no staff except in the last year when i was assisted by two yale students who assumed primary role after i had left the school system i hustled and pasted together the program with scotch tape and baling wire on an annual budget of 10001500 honoraria for guest speakers averaged 75 the program was billed as a collaborative effort between yale and the new haven school system in truth no one from either the school system nor from the yale administration had anything to do with it a friend who had been a graduate school buddy and was then a master of one of the colleges surreptitiously helped me negotiate the booking of classrooms and the auditorium the program ended in 1968 not before it became immersed in controversy and charges swirling about me as a purveyor of communist ideology and corrupter of youth though i was ultimately vindicated of same i am proud of perspectives but the reason i go into such detail is not for egoenhancement but to show what a passionate single person on a nonbudget can accomplish one year i received a christmas card it began with dear mr paros you dont know me im just one of the kids who attends perspectives a brief excerpt from it follows i wanted to drop you a note to thank you for the hard work you put into the programit really makes a kid feel really great to know that there are adults who respect his opinion and care enough about his education to offer a program like this so few adults take a sincere interest in high school students or care what they think its a darn shame maybe if high school students had more people

and the corrupt media of turning his charitable giving and faith into something malicious i will never ever apologize for giving to charitable causes or for being a christian michels wrote however the

health i have whats recently grown into a nasty habit first thing in the morning as soon as i wake up usually around 630 am or 7 am i walk into my kitchen no thats not the nasty part i stand glazed over my glucose meter for my first reading of the day then i almost always take one unit of my rapid acting insulin to keep my blood sugar from rising like mt vesuvius before i get to eat my breakfast then i take my thyroid pill and pull my longacting insulin pen out of the cup where i keep it so ill see it and take it at 9 am each morning sorry thats not the nasty habit either those are the good habits but recently ive been so focused on getting to my computer as soon as those morning bits are over since im finishing writing my third diabetes book and have a timeline of it being published by late summer that everything else goes to hell for the next few hours the worst being i am forgetting to take my 9 am longacting insulin injection true i no longer watch the morning news because even though its on im at my computer not paying attention in fact it was a shock when i learned way after the fact that tom cruise and katie holmes broke up i do make my breakfast and manage to eat it although sometimes a few hours later im not sure that i did but the really nasty bit as i alluded to before is more than once i have forgotten to take my 24hour longacting onceaday insulin shot at 9 am me who is fully committed to having my best health me who is virgoborn and inherently disciplined me whose middle name is organization well my parents didnt give me a middle name me who eschews the 30000foot view because i love the details yes the same me who has thrived on forsaking spontaneity for order when twice i forgot to take my longacting insulin shot earlier this summer i was fortunate enough to catch my mistake by 1030 am i immediately reasoned with myself that no real harm was done after all when i travel internationally i spend the first three days guessing when to take my longacting insulin yet yesterday i didnt catch my error until 5 pm the first clue that id missed my shot i ignored my blood sugar reading before lunch was higher than usual even after my daily sweatsoaked onehour walk after my same everyday breakfast then my blood sugar reading two hours after my usual salad and grilled chicken lunch beginning to see the regimentation was atypically high as that seemed worth following i checked my blood sugar again at 5 pm and it was still high now at least i had the smarts to register a perplexed and suspicious look on my face a scrunch i know i wore while i picked the longacting insulin pen out of its cup and looked at its cap i happen to have a cap with a digital timer that shows how many hours its been since i took my last shot it stared back at me with a 3208 i was stunned i had never seen a number like that before had i really entirely forgotten to take my shot this morning i looked long and hard at the numbers and that was a very long half minute i stared at the numbers i wanted to make sure i couldnt have misread it as 32 minutes which of course made no sense because that would have meant id taken my 9 am shot a half hour ago had i done that certainly i would have remembered this entire incident no that 3208 when i counted back from 5 pm meant the last time i had taken that cap off the pen to take my shot had been 32 hours ago 9 am yesterday morning incredulous but resourceful i told myself this was no worse provided it doesnt happen again than having just flown to japan and having no idea how to dose for the day then i took my shot twothirds of my usual dose figuring i only had twothirds of a day left to cover and returned to my manuscript this is all to say 1 sometimes bad things happen to good people 2 dont beat yourself up just remedy the situation and try to do a little better next time 3 technology is producing some great new diabetes devices 4 yes im writing a new book called diabetes dos howtos which you should look for early fall its everything you need to do to live healthfully with diabetes and recommendations how to do them and 5 if you want a cap on your insulin pen that will tell you when youve messed up go to timesulincom currently pens are available in europe and on the web site in euro if you have a friend in europe or a swiss bank account lucky you otherwise stay tuned for the projected us launch next year note while i was given a timesulin insulin cap at the idf world congress in dubai in full disclosure i have no commercial ties with timesulin nor have i been asked to write this or any other article for them riva speaks to patients and health care providers about flourishing with diabetes and is the author of 50 diabetes myths that can ruin your life and the 50 diabetes truths that can save it and the abcs of loving yourself with diabetes she is finishing her third book diabetes dos howtos due out this fall visit her website diabetesstoriescom
social when eleanor roosevelt and other visionaries drafted the universal declaration of human rights a short document designed to create the conditions for lasting peace and security they included education as one of these rights that would contribute to peace through the promotion of understanding tolerance and friendship among all nations racial or religious groups the horrors of the genocide perpetrated by the nazis during world war ii made selfevident the need to promote tolerance and to prevent hatred the inclusion of education as one of the fundamental human rights and the creation of the un institutions to advance education produced the remarkable achievement of providing most children around the world access to school the moral clarity that guided the inclusion of the right to education however was not sustained in the important efforts to universalize access to education that followed the adoption of the declaration and the creation of the un system consequently many children today are schooled in ways that do not promote tolerance or understanding among nations racial or religious groups the most extreme examples of such failure of education include the extremists such as the militants of isis who resort to violence against civilians not engaged in combat as a way to advance their goals apparently some of them have attended school including schools in the uk but they have clearly not been educated and in particular have not been educated to be respectful tolerant and accepting of those who have different national racial or religious identities less extreme but equally troubling forms of ethnic and religious hatred are far more prevalent around the world arguably the reason religious and ethnic hatred is perceived as the greatest global threat by a significant percentage of the worlds population a recent pew survey of global attitudes administered in 44 countries reveals religious and ethnic hatred to be the greatest threat to the world for 34 percent of the population in the middle east 24 percent of those in africa 15 percent in europe 13 percent in asia and 9 percent in latin america in the united states 24 percent of the population see this as the greatest threat to the world it is for this reason that the inclusion of global education as one of the three priorities the secretary general of the un has announced for the organization is prescient the un organizations should indeed move beyond the low bar of focusing on access to school and completion of school or achieving parity between boys and girls in those indicators as the goals that should drive global efforts to foster development and peace school graduates who hate others cant be an acceptable result of the global efforts to advance peace security and progress but it is not just the un that must embrace bolder educational aspirations the organization of economic cooperation and development which since the year 2000 has enriched the global conversation on education with the assessment of student knowledge and skills in the domains of language mathematics and science must also align its metrics of educational progress to the kind of competencies that can secure peace understanding and coexistence the failures of too limited a set of metrics to judge success are evident in the global discussion of the results of the pisa studies which unquestioningly point to finland poland south korea or china as global education paragons indeed in some of the subjects measured by pisa students in those countries perform better than students in most other nations but that is not to say that other countries should run to emulate wholesale these countries as if they were global education benchmarks for the entire educational enterprise we should balance the knowledge of the high levels of student performance in the subjects which have been testes with the knowledge that assessments such as the world values survey of populations in those and other countries reveal for example that people in china finland poland and south korea have greater levels of intolerance towards people of a different religion race immigrants or people who speak in other languages than the levels of intolerance acknowledged by respondents to the same survey in the united states before concluding that american schools should try to emulate chinese or polish schools we should tease out what aspects of the american education experience contribute to greater ethnic and religious tolerance and not throw those out on the race to catch up with the highest performing countries in pisa because some of those high performing countries are no paragons when it comes to the global threat of intolerance there is a solid base of evidence that we can draw on to support educational practices that can teach students to get along to accept and even embrace those who are different to them many thoughtful educators and leaders have translated this knowledge into programs and pedagogies that work providing all children and youth in the world access to educational experiences that will make them more tolerant and less likely to fall prey to ethnic and religious hatred is possible and within reach we need to make it a real priority of governments and ordinary citizens to build the necessary institutional coalitions to build an ecosystem that makes the promotion of peace and understanding core to the expansion of education and to use all the power of the technological tools we have available to ensure that all are schooled and educated and that this brings true understanding and the ability to get along with those we perceive to be different

sports with the recent signings of ray mcdonald and greg hardy the nfl and its team and owners have proven once again that they are tone deaf to domestic violence greg hardy and ray mcdonald were both accused of domestic violence last year both presumably will play in the nfl this season do they deserve it before last season domestic violence was a distant afterthought in the too big to fail machine that is the nfl an article posted to the good men project last year showed that the numbers on domestic violence were staggering in the 21 century there have been 769 arrests of nfl players 89 were related to domestic abuse according to usa today the nfl or the team disciplined its player only 30 of those 89 times as the photos and video evidence helped detail the violence and horror commonly associated with domestic violence the nfl was finally forced to take a stand but dont be fooled it wasnt the violence that caused the nfl and its owners to take a heavy position against domestic violence it was probably radisson hotels pulling its sponsorship from the minnesota vikings because of adrian peterson once the peterson case forced the hands of key sponsors the nfl acted swiftly the common reason for acting so negligently when enforcing consequences in regards to domestic violence was the league wanted the legal system to play out of course there is a huge problem with this reasoning when it comes to domestic violence according to the national coalition against domestic violence domestic violence is one of the most chronically underreported crimes only 25 percent of all physical assaults 20 percent of all rapes and 50 percent of all stalking perpetrated against females by their partners are reported to the police for the small number of cases that do get reported on average a woman will be assaulted by her partner or expartner thirtyfive times before reporting it to the police in the california case people v gomez a psychologist testified that about 80 percent of the time a woman who has been sexually assaulted by a boyfriend husband or lover will recant change or minimize the story when the victim of domestic violence refuses to testify eliminating the key witness prosecuting can be almost impossible we saw this in the greg hardy case in august hardy was found guilty in a bench trial on charges of communicating threats and assaulting a female in north carolina though you can appeal the case to get a jury trial when the victim in the case refused to testify with prosecutors alleging she was paid off the case was dropped what message is being sent when hardy receives no punishment from the league after being found guilty when all facts were present what message is the nfl delivering when the leagues most iconic brand then signs someone like this to a 13 million contract some might say hardy paid his debt he was put on the commissioners exempt list last year and was unable to play what makes his situation unique however is he was paid throughout his period on that list hardy in essence was on paid vacation because a judge finding him guilty of throwing his girlfriend on a stack of guns and threatening her life none of us are in support of domestic violence i think we all understand that this is about signing a player who we think can help our football team someone we did an exhaustive amount of research and due diligence on and were going to give him a chance were going to give him a chance under conditions that we think will bring the best out in him were going to hold him accountable to that no one is for domestic violence we all understand that if dallas is against domestic violence should the cowboys not be against those who commit the crime whats the difference between being against the crime but not against the person who commits the crime can we now differentiate those who commit deplorable acts from the actions themselves the ignorance of this matter neither starts nor ends with garrett the owner of the cowboys jerry jones seems to think or justify his football move by stating that hardy has paid his debt to society hes paid a terrific price had he not had this incident his contract would be one like ndamukong suh possibly but he doesnt have that so hes got more to come because the league is going to rule on if he has suspensions this year all of that is all incorporated in that agreement and the bottom line is we hope and feel that he wont do that go down this road again this problem isnt exclusive to the nfl the recent case involving former nfl safety darren sharper may show that its not the nfl thats broken but civility as a whole sharper was facing the prospects of a life in prison if convicted prosecutors in four states accused him of drugging and assaulting nine women in california he pleaded no contest to the three counts for which he was charged and agreed to a 20year sentence that will effectively be reduced by the year he has already served and credit for good behavior while incarcerated in orleans parish he is expected to plead guilty to reduced charges and receive another 20year sentence though it was not clear from courtroom sentences how his jail time on the louisiana charges would be cut to the 10 years behind bars in arizona and nevada he pleaded guilty to reduced charges with shorter maximum sentences instead of life in prison sharper will be out before he turns 50 its called a global resolution that will see him spend 10 years behind bars on all charges in criminal cases in california nevada arizona and in state and federal court in louisiana if hardy were suspended for a year without pay and forced to take classes and actually show remorse for the actions that led to a bench trial guilty verdict he would be paying the price jones referred to a second chance would be warranted hardy however isnt being granted a second chance hes still on his first and the only price being paid is on the women who continue to be viewed as second class citizens by a league that has made it clear money and wins are all that matters by wai sallas sports editor at the good men project this article originally appeared on the good men

economy washington reuters the donald trump administration has launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new us tariffs similar to those imposed on imported steel and aluminum in march the national security probe under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 would investigate whether vehicle and parts imports were threatening the industrys health and ability to research and develop new advanced technologies the commerce department said on wednesday there is evidence suggesting that for decades imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry commerce secretary wilbur ross said in a statement promising a thorough fair and transparent investigation higher tariffs could be particularly painful for asian automakers including toyota motor corp nissan motor co honda motor co and hyundai motor co which count the united states as a key market and the announcement sparked a broad selloff in automakers shares across the region the governments of japan china and south korea said they would monitor the situation while beijing which is increasingly eyeing the united states as a potential market for its cars added that it would defend its interests china opposes the abuse of national security clauses which will seriously damage multilateral trade systems and disrupt normal international trade order gao feng spokesman at the ministry of commerce said at a regular news briefing on thursday which focused largely on whether beijing and washington are making any progress in their growing trade dispute we will closely monitor the situation under the us probe and fully evaluate the possible impact and resolutely defend our own legitimate interests the probe comes as trump courts voters in the us industrial heartland ahead of midterm elections later this year and opens a new front in his america first trade agenda aimed at clawing back manufacturing jobs lost to overseas competitors it could raise the costs for overseas automakers to export vehicles and parts to the worlds secondlargest auto market growing trade tensions over cars and car parts particularly with china could raise risks for us companies expanding their presence in the country signs of which are already emerging earlier this month reuters reported that ford motor cos imported vehicles were being held up at chinese ports adding to a growing list of us products facing issues at chinas borders the majority of vehicles sold in the united states by japanese and south korean automakers are produced there but most firms also export to the us from plants in asia mexico canada and other countries roughly onethird of all us vehicle imports last year were from asia in addition to recently imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports the administration has threatened tariffs on 50 billion worth of chinese goods over intellectual property complaints and beijing has vowed to respond the administration is also trying to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement to return more auto production to the united states commerce said the new probe would determine whether lost domestic production had weakened the us internal economy and its ability to develop connected vehicle systems autonomous vehicles fuel cells electric motors and batteries and advanced manufacturing processes in a separate statement trump said core industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a nation a trump administration official said before the announcement that the expected move was aimed partly at pressuring canada and mexico to make concessions in talks to update the nafta that have languished in part over auto provisions as well as pressuring japan and the european union which also export large numbers of vehicles to the united states an ad hoc industry group representing the largest japanese german and other foreign automakers called here for america criticized the effort to our knowledge no one is asking for this protection this path leads inevitably to fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in america said john bozzella chief executive of global automakers a trade group representing toyota nissan motor co ltd hyundai motor co and others a toyota spokeswoman said that the company was monitoring the situation chinese automaker geely holding group urged free trade practices for the auto industry which is built on a complex supply chain under which vehicle components for any given car often originates from numerous countries as a global manufacturer geely holding group is in favor of free trade and open markets free trade creates jobs wealth and economic growth a spokesman said adding that its plant in south carolina to produce its volvo brand cars showed its commitment to the country shares in toyota honda and hyundai each fell roughly 3 percent in local trade following the announcement while mazda motor corp which does not have any us production capacity at the moment tumbled more than 5 percent late last week japans automakers association urged its export partners to keep tariffs on vehicles and components low and maintain free trade relationships roughly 12 million cars and trucks were produced in the united states last year while the country imported 83 million vehicles worth 192 billion this included 24 million from mexico 18 million from canada 17 million from japan 930000 from south korea and 500000 from germany according to us government statistics at the same time the united states exported nearly 2 million vehicles worldwide worth 57 billion german automakers volkswagen ag daimler ag and bmw ag all have large us assembly plants the united states is the secondbiggest export destination for german auto manufacturers after china while vehicles and car parts are germanys biggest source of export income asked if the measures would hit mexico and

environment as a long time observer of the weather and how people react to it ive come to the conclusion that we have two winter seasons not one winter before christmas and winter after christmas we dont all celebrate christmas of course but were all aware of how romanticized a white christmas is in this country from thanksgiving through christmas day or perhaps new years day its not that we tolerate snow and cold we actually enjoy it and look forward to it singers croon about a white christmas movies and animated specials are filled with images of fluffy snow falling on top of villages adorned with spectacular christmas displays even commercials are full of happy shoppers bopping around during snow storms but no one even seems to be cold or have wet feet christmas cards all look like scenes from normal rockwell paintings and we reminisce about how it used to snow more when we were younger while admitting we hope that it snows for christmas this year for the remainder of the winter which is when the majority of snow falls i might add we go back to our snowhating ways we hate the cold and we complain of fussing with boots hats and scarves we dont want to deal with travel delays associated with the weather and in fact we often plan a cruise to the caribbean or a week in cancun we hope for an early end to winter and complain if the flakes continue to fall in march or april ive written about our tendency to want to split winter into two seasons before as well as whether charles dickens is responsible for our obsession with the idea of a white christmas finally here are some images that show the snow on the ground for the past three christmas days images courtesy of the national operational hydrologic remote sensing center as you can see snow was fairly scarce last year but it widespread the previous two years especially 2009 we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again
health her words were soft and slow in coming as she struggled to breathe her body weak and frail that the effort seemed to take hours but when the words finally came they hit me with a force she said for months i have prayed for a miracle i prayed that i would wake up and this cancer would be gone that i would jump from this bed and step back into my life a life filled with busy and full days of rushing to my daughters softball games yelling at my boys to clean their rooms and balancing phone calls from the office while trying to grocery shop all the things that in the moment would have seemed stressful and annoying but in my memory today meant a normal and healthy life such a contrast to the tubes the pain and the energy that fades from me each day today as i accept the ending of my journey i no longer pray for the miracle that i wanted i accept the miracle that has been granted to me i reached out and held her cool frail hand as she took another breath and continued i have had the blessing of a life filled with people who love me i have been given the gift of parenthood and the privilege of knowing unconditional love i leave this world now fully knowing and understanding that i was here for a reason i had a purpose realizing this before i am gone has been my miracle as she closed her eyes i sat for a while thinking about her words at first it seemed odd to me that she used the word miracle as she did when i think of the word miracle i focus on the traditional meanings and connotations that is a miracle as a powerful outcome that defies logic and the powers of nature or human kind as if guided by a spiritual power an event that is statistically unlikely and for which there is no logical or human explanation as i left the hospital i took a deep breath of the cold air that hit my face and i thought about the many faces of those that i have sat bedside with through their dying process some struggled with the fear of dying and held onto anger and resentment that this had happened to them some clung to the hope of a miracle a cure and asked for every medical intervention to facilitate the cure while others resigned themselves and accepted the ending of their life some in defeat and some with peace this 42yearold woman who was only days away from taking her last breath was gifted with the awareness of her value and her worth her miracle was the realization that life her life had purpose and meaning a reality that she did not recognize when she was running through her hectic days but became clear to her as she laid in her hospital bed her miracle was a mindful focus on the moments and events that mattered a powerful reminder that despite our best efforts to control and manage our lifes path much of it is not in our control what we do control is the moments that exist in the present these are the moments that sustain us and often the ones that are reviewed at the bedside my new years wish for all of us is that we mindfully and consciously live in our moments perhaps we need to pay attention to how much energy we expend on anger and frustration at the traffic the annoying boss and our financial struggles how many times we hear ourselves saying i wish it was friday i wish it was summer i wish it was retirement etc but what if our greatest and most cherished bedside moments will happen on a monday morning or in the winter or during our work life what if our purpose and the difference we will make occurs during those moments just maybe we miss opportunities to see and hear people right in front of us as we bury ourselves in our electronic devices and put our energy into future activities and plans with only a casual recognition and glance of the present what a blessing to have our moments and the recognition of them a miracle

politics thanks to the upcoming retirement of rep jim langevin d the heavily democratic state of rhode island could be the site of one of the countrys hottest generalelection battles in november langevin has represented rhode islands 2nd congressional district which encompasses the states more conservative and rural western half since 2001 president joe biden carried the seat by 14 percentage points in 2020 but the cook political report rated the race for the open seat a toss up in june the contest is expected to be close in no small part because the presumptive republican nominee to replace langevin is former cranston mayor allan fung a selfdescribed moderate with a history of crossover appeal democrats in rhode island will decide on tuesday between six candidates to take on fung in the general election rhode island general treasurer seth magaziner former langevin aide joy fox former state rep david segal former biden cabinet official sarah morgenthau refugee activist omar bah and former state rep spencer dickinson fung led all of his potential democratic challengers in a hypothetical headtohead matchup according to a public poll conducted in june shortly before the supreme court ruling that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion allan fung is not donald trump said wendy schiller a political scientist at brown university thats the big challenge for democrats to hold the seat can they convince voters that a vote for allan fung is a vote for house republican leader kevin mccarthy and a vote for donald trump magaziner who boasts the widest array of endorsements and the largest war chest is the polling favorite even with undecideds hes got enough people who are going to affirmatively try to choose him schiller said and increasingly in the last month democrats in that district have come to see him as the most competitive against fung those democrats are persuaded that this seat could give republicans control of the house magaziner who has overseen rhode islands finances since 2014 has deep roots in democratic politics both locally and nationally magaziners father ira a successful management consultant is best known for helming president bill clintons unsuccessful health care reform initiative in 1993 and 1994 magaziner credits his familys wealth for enabling him to lend his first campaign for treasurer more than 800000 as treasurer magaziner endeared himself to rhode islands labor unions with his support for the creation of an infrastructure bank and to financial industry donors with his pursuit of aggressive nontraditional investments for the states pension fund magaziner maintains that he was simply seeking the best possible returns for retired state employees magaziner has also benefited from a head start on fundraising from an abandoned bid for governor that he launched in september 2021 he decided in late january to run for congress instead following langevins announcement that he would be retiring relieved not to have to choose between magaziner and lt gov dan mckee in the gubernatorial race top democrats labor unions and other partyaligned groups quickly coalesced behind magaziners congressional bid the league of conservation voters victory fund an environmental super pac has spent nearly 400000 in support of magaziners bid and magaziner stands to benefit from the support of langevin who endorsed him in june its time to stop the fighting and get to work magaziner is running on a relatively conventional democratic platform in his tv ads he has emphasized his support for abortion rights and stricter gun laws as well as his commitment to protecting social security and medicare im running for congress because i want to make it easier for working people to get ahead and build a good stable life he declared in a sept 1 debate there are signs however that magaziner would resemble more businessfriendly members of the house democratic caucus though not quite to the extent of the partys most conservative outliers while he has picked up the endorsement of progressive boston mayor michelle wu hes also been endorsed by rep jake auchincloss dmass a prominent moderate although magaziner is refusing to accept contributions from political action committees affiliated with the gun fossil fuel and pharmaceutical industries he has not forsworn money from all corporate pacs and web3 forward a super pac that advocates for lighter regulation of the cryptocurrency industry has spent over 162000 on advertisements supporting magaziner magaziner has also distinguished himself from his rivals by criticizing bidens forgiveness of 10000 in student debt for americans earning under 125000 he has said he prefers to reduce interest rates on loans but told huffpost in an interview that he would not vote against bidens debt cancellation if it were put to a vote in congress and it was the only real reform on the table what im very concerned about as well is that we fix the underlying structural issues about how higher education is financed so we dont end up in the same situation five years from now he said other contenders have made the case that they are more electable against fung than magaziner would be and in the event of an upset loss for magaziner democrats will get a chance to test alternative theories of electability in a state where democratic congressional candidates are less accustomed to contentious general elections sarah morgenthau a former department of commerce official under biden and department of homeland security official under president barack obama has raised the secondlargest amount of money after magaziner they are the only two candidates who have been able to advertise on television morgenthau whose mother unsuccessfully sought the seat in 1988 is running more than anything on her identity as a woman and the possibility of becoming the first democratic woman to represent rhode island in congress one of her tv ads features the lyrics roe roe roe your vote a reference to the overturned roe v wade decision that created a constitutional right to abortion to the tune of row row row your boat its time to stop the fighting and get to work she told huffpost thats what ive been about throughout my life and throughout my career morgenthau said she is the candidate best equipped to beat fung because among other things she is coming in with a heck of a lot of experience but morgenthau a granddaughter of the new dealera treasury secretary henry morgenthau has considerable baggage she owns a summer home in rhode island but only made the state her permanent home recently in order to run for congress rhode island has been my home for 40 years morgenthau insisted during a recent televised democratic primary debate noting her mothers run for congress in the area over three decades ago while my heart is here in rhode island my experience has been everywhere and its exactly that experience that i will bring to bring back results for folks here in rhode island magaziner has a less striking residency problem of his own having moved into the district from his former home on the east side of providence in order to run in rhode islands 2nd magaziner said that his work as treasurer which included school construction and cleanenergy financing plans have put him in touch with the districts needs i will put my hometown girl against his hometown boy all day long ive worked in every city and town in the district to solve problems he told huffpost by contrast fox a political consultant and former local journalist who also worked for former rhode island gov gina raimondo d now the us secretary of commerce touts her local ties a resident of warwick fox jokes that she doesnt commute much beyond her family home in cranston where she and her mother are caring for a father with alzheimers disease i grew up in the city fung was mayor of fox said i will put my hometown girl against his hometown boy all day long fox also noted that she was part of the campaign team that helped raimondo defeat fung in two consecutive gubernatorial races the challenge for fox is in letting enough democratic voters know she exists despite her small budget and convincing them shell be able to scale up in a competitive race come november you could envision joy fox beating allan fung with money because joy fox can use the national theme of beating republicans and also claim the mantle of a local rhode islander who was born and raised here schiller said omar bah a political refugee from gambia who founded a nonprofit that serves refugees in providence is a longshot candidate who had raised less than 63000 as of late august but he too has an electability case to make arguing that a failure to nominate him risks ceding a portion of nonwhite voters to fung with whom they may identify because he has chinese ancestry if allan fung goes against seth magaziner or any other white candidate he will take a large chunk of people of color from the democratic party who otherwise would have voted for me bah told huffpost the policy differences between magaziner fox morgenthau and bah are relatively modest and not a major focus of their respective bids dickinson and segal by contrast are making an ideological case albeit from opposite ends of the spectrum dickinson argues that the democratic party has moved much too far to the left prompting centrist and conservative voters to leave the party dickinson has sparse policy material on his campaign website but he does name closing the usmexico border as his highest priority if the president wont do it then the congress must he declares use the army if necessary segal who founded the advocacy group demand progress and is backed by sen elizabeth warren dmass has carved out the progressive lane in the race running as a foe of corporate special interests and political corruption segals platform includes the standard array of leftwing policies including support for medicare for all and the green new deal but segal also emphasizes his record of building bipartisan coalitions for liberal goals like reducing the power of big technology firms and ending us support for the saudi arabialed invasion of yemen and he insists that without a populist critique of a rigged economic and political system democrats are at a disadvantage against fung the general election here needs to be taken really seriously segal said the way to do that is to nominate somebody who has a 20year record of taking on outsize corporate power this is a really popular fight rhode island has a history of electing democrats with socially conservative tendencies until recently many top democrats in the state legislature supported gun rights and restrictions on abortion access segal nonetheless hopes to appeal to the states sizable population of workingclass voters some of whom have shown a receptiveness to a populist message the states democratic primary voters opted for sen bernie sanders ivt over former secretary of state hillary clinton during the 2016 presidential primary some of sanders biggest margins were in warwick and cranston key population centers in rhode islands 2nd sanders endorsed segal last thursday the way to do that is to nominate somebody who has a 20year record of taking on outsize corporate power this is a really popular fight what segal lacks in tv advertising he could make up for in grassroots support which carries greater weight in lowturnout races segals campaign released an internal poll earlier this month that showed him gaining ground on magaziner and the working families party has since spent more than 87000 on paid phone banking and digital ads in support of segals bid finally the mysterious super pac ocean state forward has emerged as a wild card with a lastminute spending spree in the races final days the group whose funders and agenda are unknown has spent more than 102000 on directmail literature attacking magaziner seth magaziner claims to be a progressive democrat who fights for working families but he has taken more special interest campaign cash than any candidate for congress one mail item alleges ocean state forward is run by democratic political operative jennifer may but the attack mirrors the critiques of magaziner that national republicans have already made allan fung led the cranston comeback and has proven that oneparty rule is hurting rhode islanders whose cost of living has surged with democrats in control samantha bullock a spokesperson for the national republican congressional committee said in a statement there couldnt be a greater contrast between fung and silver spoon seth magaziner whose political career is bankrolled by his rich dad while he works to deliver for his wall street friends regardless of the races outcome on tuesday national democrats are preparing to nationalize the general election and paint fung as a foot soldier for republican house leader kevin mccarthy rcalif fung gave the party some ammunition when he welcomed mccarthy in person to raise money for him in rhode island in august he also attended mccarthys national gop donor retreat in wyoming later in the month fung who opposes lateterm abortions and public funding for abortions has said that restricting abortion would not be a priority for him in congress in rhode island theyve already spoken about this issue fung told the boston globe referring to the states codification of abortion rights in 2019 and im not running to try to change the laws on abortion but fung would not commit to supporting federal legislation codifying abortion rights which democrats see as grounds enough to brand him an abortion rights opponent we remain committed to

worldnews food security has taken on a new dimension almost five months into the gulf crisis that pits a uaesaudi alliance against qatar and for which there is no resolution in sight the uae and saudi arabia would deny that they are attempting to starve qatar into submission with their diplomatic and economic boycott that has forced qatar to seek alternative food suppliers and alternative air and sea shipment routes yet de facto their strategy is to drive the cost of qatari food and other imports up to the point that the wealthy gulf state no longer can afford the more expensive imports in the process the boycott has redefined the national security aspects of food security particularly for small states that are more vulnerable to external pressures food security amounted for the gulf states in the first decade of the 21st century to ensuring access in a global market in which shortages were driving up prices the gulf states responded to the food crises and massive price hikes in 20072008 and in 20102011 by following in the footsteps of china south korea and europe and acquiring huge tracts of agricultural land in asia and africa ironically high oil prices were one driver of the increased cost of food that prompted some exporters in africa and asia confronted with domestic shortages to restrict exports the restrictions were what prompted the gulf states to go on their land acquisition binge at the time food security was for cashrich but soilpoor gulf states a question of market supply and demand and ensuring the food supply chain at whatever price that narrow definition first changed with the popular arab revolts in 2011 that toppled longstanding autocrats and sparked civil wars and a counterrevolution some of those revolts like in syria which started as a peaceful protest in demand of change before it deteriorated into a catastrophic civil war were prompted in part by droughts that effected the agricultural economy with the revolts food security took on a far greater domestic security aspect for autocratic gulf leaders whose legitimacy was rooted in a social contract that promised a cradletograve subsidized welfare state in exchange for surrender of all political rights the gulf crisis however has taken the dimensions of food security for the gulf as well as small states elsewhere to a new level food security no longer is primarily about commercial access or preferred access to world markets at times of shortages and rising prices control of agricultural resources in farflung lands no longer provides necessary levels of security the gulf crisis has broadened the aim of food security particularly for small states to include a diversified supply guaranteed shipping routes and selfsufficiency to the degree possible as a means of defense against attempts to starve a small state into submission the defense and security as opposed to market aspects of food have taken on additional significance not only because of qatars need to fend off pressure on its food supplies by neighbours determined to undermine its independence and force it to adhere to policies devised in abu dhabi and riyadh rather than doha the most recent joint agricultural outlook of the united nations food and agriculture organisation fao and the organisation for economic cooperation and developments oecd for the next ten years suggests that the food crises of the first decade of the 21st century are for now a thing of the past prices for the main crops livestock and fish products all fell in 2015 signalling that an era of high prices is quite likely over for all subsectors the outlook said food security is at the core of qatars ability to resist uaesaudi pressure its continued capability to do so will likely define perceptions of margins of manoeuvrability that small states have in relationship to big brothers it sometimes takes war or the threat of war to make countries look at their food security john dore an irishman who is helping qatar become selfsufficient in dairy products told the guardian to compensate for the effects of the uaesaudi blocking of land sea and air routes qatar initially shifted the bulk of its dairy imports from saud arabia to turkey and iran trade between qatar and iran has increased by 60 percent since the imposition of the boycott in early june importing thousands of cows from europe and the united states mr dores operation within a matter of months has been able to supply up to 40 percent of qatars milk needs he expects that the import of another 10000 animals over the next year will make qatar

qatars enormous wealth gave it a leg up in its ability to fund resilience and its refusal to cave into the demands of its bigger brothers in doing so it relied not only on its financial muscle but also on the relationships and dependencies it established by diversifying the client base for its liquified natural gas nonetheless the long and short of qatars fight is that how the battle in the gulf unfolds and how the crisis is resolved will likely have farreaching consequences for definitions of food security priorities in shaping food security strategies and the architecture of international relations as small states gain confidence recognizing that size is no longer the only or main factor that determines their ability to chart an independent course dr james m dorsey is a

science more than 8000 miles from new york city a team of a few dozen goes on safari every day films everything they encounter and broadcasts the results live on the internet the threehour show starts at 5 am local time near south africas kruger national park 10 pm eastern and is repeated again in the afternoon one morning viewers may spot a leopard sleeping in a marula tree paws dangling over either side of a branch a few minutes later that same leopard may chow on an early breakfast gulping down the ribcage of an impala she hoisted up to keep away from hyenas for the evening drive that leopard may be gone replaced by a herd of elephants a termite mound or a southern masked weaver building its nest whatever the team at wildearth stumble on that day viewers see in realtime alongside commentary from experienced safari guides the team led by married couple graham and emily wallington has filmed from the djuma game reserve about 300 miles northeast of johannesburg for years the reserve shares a border with kruger south africas most famous national park and nearly all of the animals associated with a safari are there including the big five the plan to broadcast live content began with a camera screwed into a tree above a watering hole in 1998 that would take a still image every 30 seconds or so that camera now in full video still operates nearly two decades later albeit in a different tree after one was downed by a storm another an elephant the first live safari was broadcast in 2007 and has been running ever since two guides venture out twice daily in land rovers outfitted with a camera rig on the back another is out often on foot for a bush walk antennas strapped to the back of the vehicles or a cameraman if its a walk transmit the signal back to a control room on site or in johannesburg where its fed directly online with no more than a few seconds delay about a thousand viewers are tuned in at any time many diehard fans watch daily and anyone can ask questions via twitter in real time how many spots does a leopard have do elephants get wrinklier over time tweet the control room and within minutes the guides will turn towards the camera and answer for you using years of guiding experience to explain that those spots are actually rosettes and that it depends on the cat as with any live broadcast things can go wrong and they do if its cloudy the antennas may not be able to broadcast their signal and the feed will cut out microphones can stop transmitting and if it rains too strongly which it seldom does as south africas in a hardcore drought no safari but the team expertly navigates many of these issues on the fly and a guide on a bush walk can chat entertainingly for an hour about the different moths they stumble across should a vehicle get a thorn in a tire all of this prep culminates the day after thanksgiving when wildearth broadcasts its video feed directly to american homes on nat geo wild the exclusively animal cable affiliate of the magazine this is the second year graham and emily wallingtons crew will host its show for an audience of millions and it can get exciting last year the cameras captured the birth of a wildebeest another broadcast saw a pack of wild dogs killing a pregnant impala in an extremely graphic but very primal encounter that few had seen live these are wild animals and there really is no telling what will or wont happen or what big cats are elusive and a favored tree can be far from the reach of a land rover but for those unable to venture to south africa the experience provides viewers with the real thrill of a game drive where animals roam in their native habitats graham wallington said the live broadcasts provide a step above the reality shown on a nature documentary where lions perform a half dozen kills in a few minutes we all love to see the burst of action but wildearths reality is a little more real and a pride may laze about for 20 hours a day with the only action being a big male rolling onto his back in the sun even the team of experienced guides cant guarantee whatll happen a very grounded fear for a crew ramping up for just its second cable broadcast we

health there is a secret club in this country its members are taking part in activities that most consider taboo like fight club the cult movie classic based upon chuck palahniuks novel members meet to engage in a human behavior more basic and primitive than fighting this is nap club and the first rule of nap club is you do not talk about nap club napping has long been a subject of much curiosity and debate individuals who do not sleep enough or have intrinsic problems with their sleep like sleep apnea can often use napping to make up for the quality rest that they are missing while this compensatory sleep may lead to delays in the diagnosis of the underlying sleep disorder napping in moderation is generally viewed as a positive evidence has shown that napping can be an easy and safe way to improve alertness and focus particularly after getting an inadequate amount of nocturnal sleep 1 2 in much the same way society frowns upon grown men meeting in parking garages and beating each other up society is equally dismissive of napping sleep that occurs during the day is often viewed as being a mark of laziness sleeping on the job is not viewed as a trait of the successful driven employee on many occasions patients have admitted to me that they sneak naps during the day by far and away the parking lot car snooze is the most popular in this scenario the patient quickly inhales their lunch on their way out to their car once the seat is back and the cell phone alarm is set the sleeper is ready to squeeze as much sleep into their break as they can before they have to be back in the office not every napper feels it necessary to leave the office though just like george costanza demonstrated when he devised a nap haven under his desk many individuals hide out in their office and sleep one patient who teaches school had a nap lair so elaborately designed that detection was virtually impossible i would publish details but i promised not to for fear that it would compromise his defenses is napping ever going to lose this stigma and be embraced by the masses that depends on who you ask in many european countries afternoon napping or siestas are viewed as commonplace much to the dismay of foreign travelers life often shuts down in the afternoon as widespread rest and napping occurs in colleges throughout the united states napping is a regular occurrence sleeping students are as common as awake students in campus libraries and the design of much of the furniture in these libraries suggests that the behavior if not being encouraged is at least being supported at my alma mater the university of virginia architecture students elevated the daytime nap to a level of artistic brilliance with intricate sleeping lofts being constructed over their drafting tables within the school newer bastions of nap acceptance are often welldocumented in the media when google or zappos opens up their headquarters and the media is allowed to see the elaborate nap rooms set up for their employees to utilize between periods of work and riding scooters around the office 3 these forwardthinking companies have seen the power of napping when it comes to productivity and employee feelings of wellbeing 4 the problem is how do people create a society of napping acceptance if they dont happen to work for nike i think i have seen the answer it revealed itself to me one morning when i turned on my office computer there on the screen was a pillow this was no ordinary pillow this was a pillow specifically designed for napping that was unlike anything i have ever seen the pillow is worn on the head blocking the light and thus creating a perfect nap environment no matter where the wearer finds himself in a library in an airport anywhere this was not what got my attention what captured my imagination was the fact that the wearer of the so called ostrich pillow looked like a freshlypicked scallion to say that the sleeper looks like an ostrich is a disservice to ostriches to put it bluntly the wearer could easily walk into that star wars cantina be served without any controversy and probably get a job with the house band on the spot and this is precisely why the ostrich pillow may lead the napping revolution in this country not because it works it does and not because it is extremely comfortable it is but because it makes an incredibly bold statement the wearer is no longer ashamed of napping the wearer is loudly declaring that not only is napping a good thing but hes not going to hide the fact that hes doing it this napper is going to don this huge head wrap put his head down on the starbucks table and sleep a glorious sleep unabashedly proud that he is doing something positive for his body so obviously as both a sleep doctor and someone who travels frequently i had to have a pillow for myself after some amateur internet investigation i tracked down kawamuraganjavianstudio banana things the makers of the symbol of napping freedom that i envisioned the oppressed and sleepy masses would raise like a flag as they charged into this new american renaissance note be careful charging anywhere wearing this thing as it is impossible to see when you are wearing it i excitedly called to request my pillow only to find that not only was i calling spain but that the studio was currently closed most likely to take a nap figures caption

health it happens so fast that you barely have time to react how is it possible that something that only takes a matter of seconds to transpire can have such a lasting effect im talking about a hit and run have you ever been involved in one whether you have been involved in a literal hit and run car accident or a metaphorical hit and run that affected your personal relationships emotions or career you know the lasting impact that such an incident can leave in your life if it goes untreated normally when a hit and run occurs certain steps should immediately be taken step 1 call the police and report the incident to your insurance alerting the police and your insurance company are vital steps to take because one should alert the proper authorities after harm has occurred in our daytoday lives we often attempt to handle personal crises or hit and run incidents on our own instead or alerting the proper authorities in our lives eg family loved ones friends etc who can help us assess the matter in order to determine the next steps we can take to resolve the traumatic situation step 2 seek medical treatment if physical injury occurred if you are involved in a hit and run you would immediately seek medical treatment if you have suffered any physical harm as a result of the accident this sounds sensible yet it is the step least followed by many individuals when trauma occurs sometimes we as human beings are not aware of the negative effects of the trauma or we choose to ignore it and work through the pain the problem with this method is that pain resonates when pain goes untreated it will only get worse until it eventually becomes unbearable many factors such as the lack of a solid support system or low self confidence can give any one the catalyst to argue that their physical emotion and mental health is not a priority and thus the injured person will create a list of excuses concerning how they will be able to function normally in their current broken state lets face the truth we all need help at some time in our lives we often fail to seek help from the proper sources eg family psychologist pastor etc to help us out of a particularly stressful situation because we are afraid that we would be viewed as weak or fragile for seeking assistance in reality the individuals who seek help are wiser and stronger than those who choose to endure the pain lets be clear seeking help does not make you weak it simply shows that you are secure enough to know that trauma exists in your life and you are not comfortable living with its negative effects on a continuous basis the question is are you a victim or a victor life is 10 percent of what you go through and 90 percent of how you handle it which of the categories do you fall in are you suffering through life enduring the aches and pains of trauma that previously occurred in your life or are you the person who has endured pain and is willing to use available resources to achieve a healthy balanced life pain is relative and suffering is optional do not choose to suffer through anything in silence make a promise to yourself that you can and will take the necessary steps to fully recover from a hit and run who knows you could be the driving force responsible for assisting a person in completely recovering or even avoiding their next personal crisis for more on emotional wellness click here
environment last month i wrote two articles here here gave an interview to the real news network here and an interview to uprising radio here about the devastating floods in colorado with boulder as its epicenter the floods damaged more than 2000 squares miles along the colorado front rangefrom colorado springs to fort collins ten people were killed nearly 18000 homes were damaged or destroyed hundreds of miles of road were washed out and thousands of oil and gas wells flooded resulting in environmental contamination from toxic fracking fluids and nearly 40000 gallons of spilled oil boulder got nearly its annual average rainfall in just five days and it happened at a wrong timeseptember not julyaugust when rain usually falls in the desert southwest my main contribution was to raise the noise level that the corporate media had failed miserably in its reporting of the colorado floods not a single journalist had raised the question on corporate tv did global warming play a part in causing or intensifying the colorado floods bamboozled by the lure of technology humans have become deeply amnesic we forget a tragedy soon after the corporate media stops reporting on a particular catastrophe in a globally warmed earth however before amnesia sets in the next assault arrives this morning i woke up to the news of super cyclone phailin in the bay of bengal that will make landfall tomorrow in the east coast of india odisha and andhra pradesh braced for the very severe cyclone that is expected to hit the east coast with winds gusting up to 220 kmph 136 mph tomorrow evening as lakhs 1 lakh100000 of people were being evacuated to safer places and the military kept on standby the hindu reports i had lived in the american southwest for eleven years and i was born and grew up in bengal so the recent colorado floods and the super cyclone in the bay of bengal are personal there are already many news articles on the india cyclone that you can read the hindu here times of india here india today here bbc here washington post here i wont go into the details instead ill focus on bringing attention to two things naming and blaming apparently phailin was named by thailand and it means sapphire in thai what nonsense some humans do desire the precious stone but no one id think is desiring phailin india should rename this meaningless obfuscation and call attention to global warming immediately there was also some confusion about whether this is a cyclone or a super cyclone on thursday the india meteorological department had indicated that the wind speed would be limited to 185 kmph but now the forecast is at 220 kmph and the us navy has indicated that the wind speed will be above 240 kmph so before the cyclone makes a landfall it will turn into a deadly super cycloneyet another example of extreme weather event the india today has posted a very useful article what is a super cyclone the article gives an excellent explanation of the 1999 odisha super cyclone also known as cyclone 05b it struck the coast of odisha with a height of ocean water 26 feet 8 meters approximately 275000 homes were destroyed leaving 167 million people homeless another 195 million people were affected by the super cyclone to some degree a total of 9803 people officially died from the storm though it is believed that 15000 people died the india today reports the article also mentions how the rescue operation proceeded by placing this article in the context of the impending super cyclone in the exact same landscape journalists in india are doing a better job than how the colorado floods were reported last month but it could be better it needs to better and make an explicit connection to global warming india today explained tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water they derive their energy from the evaporation of water from the ocean surface which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation there is our clueconnection of the impending super cyclone with global warming all the articles i have come across on the impending bay of bengal cyclone however avoided using the phraseglobal warming the anthropogenic global warming caused by accumulation of greenhouse gases is making the oceans warmer which in turn is causing more frequent and more intense cycloneshurricanes and floods the un ipcc fifth assessment reports ar5 first part the summary for policymakers spm was released two weeks ago more than a 1000 scientists from all over the world contributed to the report and the team worked for six years the spm was approved by 190 nations all that means that the ipcc ar5 is a conservative estimate of global warming the reality will likely be worse than what the ipcc is saying having said all that the ipcc reports states ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system accounting for more than 90 of the energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010 high confidence it is virtually certain that the upper ocean 0700 m warmed from 1971 to 2010 we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves

worldnews this month kazakhstan kicked off astana expo 2017 the first international exposition to be held in the former soviet union the theme of astanas expo is future energy heads of asian and european powers including president xi jinping indian premier narendra modi and king of spain felipe vi among others opened the expo together with kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev over the course of the summer 115 countries will be represented at the expo and an estimated 3 million people from around the world are expected to visit hosting an expo focusing on the future of energy production and consumption makes perfect sense while one of the goal of the expo is to promote solutions to energy problems around the world this is certainly also an opportunity to showcase kazakhstan as a regional leader in central asia for centuries central asia has sat at a crucial geopolitical crossroads muslims and christians turkic and slavic peoples have cohabited in the vast steppe for centuries the region is also the convergence of many of americas challenges in the world in addition to the big playersus russia and chinairan india pakistan saudi arabia and turkey are playing increasingly important roles in the region some of these actors have shared interests while many times they are competitors this creates a tangled web of alliances and interests in what is already a complicated neighborhood of the world the best way for the us to weave its way through the challenges of the region is by having a strong bilateral relationship with kazakhstan already the number one us partner in the region this is why president trumps meeting with nazarbayev in saudi arabia last month was of note the us spent much effort to develop relations with kazakhstan since the 1990s focusing on nuclear disarmament oil and gas and market reforms the ties are still going strong there are five reasons why the trump administration needs to engage with the central eurasian region and improve uskazakh relations first the radical islamist threat as a secular muslimmajority country kazakhstan has been able to counter the rise of extremism making it a natural partner for the us as foreign fighters supporting isis start fleeing syria there is a risk many could return back to their homelands and thousands of them did come from the countries of central asia to continue their nefarious activities kazakhstan is well aware of this and has shown a willingness to work with the us and others to prevent radicalism from becoming a destabilizing force in central asia secondly kazakhstan has a track record and commitment to nuclear nonproliferation one of the countrys greatest achievements since 1991 has been its championing the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons it divested itself of all the nukes left behind by the soviets and kazakhs are proud of this fact as north korea continues to test nuclear weapons and as the future of the iran nuclear deal remains uncertain kazakhstans voice in the nonproliferation debate is crucialespecially while kazakhstan is serving its two year term as a nonpermanent member of the un security council thirdly there is huge economic potential in kazakhstan as the recent astana economic forum in which the worlds leading economists and businessmen took part had highlighted it is the economic leader in central asia with gdp greater than the rest of the region combined additionally there are also trade and investment opportunities for the us and its allies us exports to kazakhstan totaled more than 1 billion in 2016 fourth is massive hydrocarbon potential kazakhstans location on the caspian sea littoral means it is one of the key energy players in the in the world with 19 million barrels a day output projected in 2018 by international energy agency higher than opec member angola kazakhstan oil production helps offset european oil and gas dependency with kazakh resources and further develop local petrochemical industry this in turn has an indirect impact on us security interests in europe because each barrel of oil and cubic foot of natural gas europe gets from kazakhstan is one less it gets from russia kazakhstan also supplies above the fifth of us civilian uranium for power generation fifth and probably the least often thought of when it comes to kazakhstan is afghanistan while kazakhstan does not share a direct land border with afghanistan the region is intertwined with historic trading routes still linking the two countries today kazakhstan has played a constructive role in the country over the years it has offered millions of dollars worth of assistance and has agreed trade deals with kabul worth hundreds of millions of dollars more as the regions biggest economy and a secular republic kazakhstan has a direct interest to ensure that afghanistan becomes stable the threat of afghanistans destabilization for the security and stability of the broader region is particularly important as president trump decides what his administrations afghan policy will be as the first nonpermanent un security council member from central asia and as its chairman next january kazakhstan also is doing much to attract global attention to the region including afghanistan we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the

americas side
social ninety two percent of teens report going online daily including 24 percent who say they go online almost constantly according to a new study from pew research center april 2015 todays tween and teens are given a powerful tool that enables them to connect with people places and things globally with little to no cyber citizenship education a lack of cyber education puts teens and tweens at a greater risk of human trafficking identity theft and cyber bullying i remember sending my first text and opening my first myspace account i was 13 years old even though the smart phone was not in existence my world of communication was forever changed i was also 13 when i experienced the hateful words of a jealous girl who decided that making my life miserable would somehow make her feel better about herself i havent mentioned anything about cyber education and how it taught us to use the internet as well as how to stay kind and safe on social media because there was none fast forward to the summer of 2014 i felt passionate about all texas middle schools providing education for youth in cyber citizenship where do i begin such a journey well i love the motto go big or go home so i requested a meeting with senator donna campbells staff at the texas capital in austin this meeting would be the starting point of a yearlong journey i will never ever forget opening the email from james holcomb who was an intern reporting to jon oliver communications director for senator donna campbell was a little scary and very exciting all at the same time my request for a meeting was granted and now i will have the opportunity to give a presentation on why i feel cyber citizenship is crucial for texas public schools walking into the capital was a bit overwhelming i visited this historic building on a field trip when i was in grade school and to walk in with such a purpose i somehow felt a sense of pride and honor to live in the great state of texas mr holcomb and mr oliver greeted me with enthusiasm and listening intently to my presentation they both agreed that educating youth to be safe and productive online was needed and necessary in the school system they also mentioned with enthusiasm senator campbells passion for youth and the importance of education my next stop was the texas education agencys director ms shelly ramos even though i knew i had nothing to lose i was a bit nervous speaking to ms ramos but knew it was crucial for her to hear from a 19yearold how important this course would be for the lives of youth throughout texas i held my breath for what seemed like longer than any human should be able to as i waited for her to respond she said exactly what i hoped she would say this course is needed in our school system and lauren i believe you can accomplish the goal of bringing cyber education to our youth my voice became the spokesperson for every tween and teen throughout the state of texas i began to feel the pressure to push forward and make it happen ms ramos put me in touch with her staff and the next thing i knew i was on my way to creating a cyber citizenship innovative course that would educate youth to stay safe and productive online giving them a foundation and platform to connect safely within a global community as they begin their life journey of reaching their goals and dreams i spent the next six months writing and editing this course the time drew near for executive approval and as i made my last edits i couldnt help but think about my journey and the empowerment that educators will be giving youth as this course is administered i am proud to say cyber citizenship is officially approved by the tea and will be offered beginning in the 20152016 school year for all texas middle schools this innovative course has the ability to not only keep students safe online but to also give them an understanding of their digital footprint as they learn to evaluate leadership qualities and the transfer of those qualities from the cyber world to facetoface interaction i am extremely proud to have my nonprofit organization girls above society connected to educating youth in such a powerful way the internet has the potential to connect us with amazing mentors who will educate us and help us reach our goals and dreams if we are educated and have the tools needed to use it wisely tweens and teens of today are beginning now to shape and mold their future why not give them the tools they need for a cyber smart safe and healthy tomorrow
science are sexist comments keeping women from pursuing careers in science and technology when we posed that question to users on the whisper app the responses flooded in as a followup here are the stories our own readers shared with us scroll down weve shortened some a bit and highlighted the most cringeworthy passages but otherwise weve left them just as they wereincluding some graphic language if you make it to 11 at the bottom of the page youll see one anecdote that gives us a glimmer of hope in both grammar and high school i was told by other girls that no one will ever like me because youre too nerdy and like gross stuff in an all girls high school other students would tell me that im smart but not smart enough to be a biologist people constantly told me oh its so great that youre going into physics we need more women in science like the only value i brought to the field would be increasing the number of women regardless of how good my work was i was at a swing dance and when i was talking to another dancer we started asking each other about majors when i told him i was a physics major his immediate response was youre too pretty to be a physicist at a stem focused school with over 80 male students i felt like i was constantly being sexualized by my peers i felt like the programs made to get more women into the school ignored the fact that once women get into stem theyre often mistreated if stem fields had a reputation for being safe for female professionals they wouldnt have such a problem i think they need to change from the inside by eliminating sexist attitudes among professors and employers rather than going out and asking women to change and accept mistreatment to be a woman in science once the school got us interested with their outreach programs they seemed to forget about what other needs women might have such as not being sexualized in class sexual assault reporting services and respect for their work try being a female and declaring that you study reproductive physiology and do research on sperm try it i dare you i am most interested in embryology but avoid telling that to other students because they instantly explain away my scientific interest as my maternal nature i never wear pink to the lab or anything that might remind everyone that i am in fact a blonde female male colleagues assume that i cant operate laboratory machinery and usually dont bother to teach me because theyll just do it themselves when i was in undergrad my advisor told me that i should change my major because i was never going to keep up with the math and science courses required for graduation i graduated with honors that same professor told me when i was choosing a graduate school that since i got accepted to a program that meant that all of my classmates would get in to that school also the only other students who applied at the same school were male in high school my guidance counsellors both male and female said that i wasnt smart enough to get into engineering and that even if i did i wouldnt be able to complete the program and get a good job or one that pays well they encouraged me to go to college for an engineering technician program instead because it was easier and there were more girls there when the boys in my class whose marks were far worse than mine told the teachers that they wanted to be engineers they were congratulated on picking such a good field and told that they would do really well i just started my first year of engineering at one of canadas best engineering universities no thanks to any of the guidance counsellors or careers teachers at my high school ps none of the boys who applied to my university for engineering even got in when i was working on my biology bs i had a misogynistic physics professor he stated in class that women do not belong in the physics field whether as students or physicists the lecture was about 5050 and then he tried to purposely fail a number of female students by accidently misplacing our exams and claiming we never took them i went over his head and talked to the head of department and our exams were magically found guess who got fired at the end of that semester im a college student in computer science during my first technical internship a coworker swiped through my phone and asked if i had any nudes in it i had only talked to this man twice my supervisor swept a coil of vga cables out of a cabinet shelf and on to the floor for me to pick up in front of him another coworker told me that the only women hed seen in technical fields were butch dykes a coworker asked if i had a boyfriend and when i said yes he said thats all that college girls care about i lost count of the number of times i was winked at by men twice my age while walking down the halls my first day in this major during orientation a professor looked to another and chuckled that i must be a smart girl to be in computer science another computer science student once sincerely asked me if i needed help plugging my laptop cable in to the outlet the women in computing club is openly mocked by all but one of my male computer science friends speaking of male compsci friends i cannot keep any very long since after a while they take my complete disinterest toward them as a sign of attraction and attempt to make a move female friends are almost impossible to make since i work with primarily male engineers and my classrooms are almost all male last week during lecture i looked up in a class of fifty and realized there were only two other women in the room i was the only girl in my calculus ii class its the little things im a nurse at the time of this incident i had a master of science degree i worked in a medical science lab where i had written grants contributed to papers and advised others on experimental design i helped write the job description for research scientist so i knew that i qualified but when i asked my male physician boss for the promotion he said no nurses arent scientists nurses are supposed to be nice i pointed out to him that i met the job description i got the promotion i had an unpaid internship working for a small field research company i worked at my bosss house caring for 50 turtles newts and salamanders one day he and his wife cornered me to give me career advice that i should either gain 50 pounds or become a butch dyke lesbian if i ever wanted to be taken seriously in the environmental field i stopped showing up soon after and switched to environmental education a more femaledominated field ever since i was little i was interested in robotics computers and programming i grew up coloring on old punch cards and playing at typing on dos and watching my grandfather build computers from scratch or else watching robot wars on tv and designing bots specifically to better the ones i saw with my crayons by age 8 i was beating teenagers at competitive robot programming demos that allowed audience participation but as i started trying to reach out to groups its a bit weird to have maybe one other girl in the group who more often than not sort of sideeyes you as bad as the guys if not worse which looking back now was probably them wondering if theyd lose their place as the token girl and to say it was disheartening is an understatement and now the first words out of anyones mouth to me are shock and surprise then jokes about being a girl interested in robots and old computers and programming apps like i havent already heard them all a thousand times followed immediately by talking down to me despite my knowing literally every term they throw at me even and especially obscure ones nothing i say or do is ever good enough to get past the condescending tone im lucky i also love and have a passion for art and martial arts at least here i can kick the ass of or outaudition anyone who tries to cold shoulder or talk down to me historically it has been said that science is a mans field i wonder what would happen if the people saying this would do some simple research and discover women like madam curie and hedy lamarr my mother even said after my college graduation upon where i received my bachelor of science in geology with a minor degree in geographic information systems and a specialization in hydrology that instead of a diploma the president of the university should have handed me a plastic figure of male genitalia because then at least i would receive the same wages respect and a chance for a job as my male colleagues to brighten this story however i would like to point out that the faculty of the geology department at my alma mater nearly all of whom are male lifted the spirits and encouraged all of their students regardless of gender or background whenever i was feeling unsure about my future or my intellect these professors would raise my spirits and make me feel as if i could accomplish anything they constantly reminded me to never doubt myself because many of sciences great discoveries were made by people who were shunned in the eyes of society what do you think are sexist comments keeping women out of science share your own experience using mystemstory
politics the sworn affidavit that prosecutors used to persuade a federal judge to let them search donald trumps maralago home earlier this month says that classified documents would likely be found there as well as evidence of obstruction according to a redacted version released friday there is probable cause to believe that additional documents that contain classified ndi or that are presidential records subject to record retention requirements currently remain at the premises there is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found at the premises the heavily redacted 38page affidavit reads ndi refers to national defense information a category of documents considered highly sensitive the department of justices proposed redactions and reasons for those redactions were also released the affidavit filed by an fbi agent from the washington dc office with training in counterintelligence and espionage investigations says that the agency was brought in to investigate by the national archives after officials there found that 15 boxes retrieved from maralago earlier this year included highly classified material of most significant concern was that highly classified records were unfoldered intermixed with other records and otherwise unproperly sic identified the fbi agent wrote the fbi did a preliminary review of the material in those boxes and found documents with classification markings in 14 out of the 15 the special agent wrote describing the documents using a string of acronyms referring to classified material and fpotus for former president trump a preliminary triage of the documents with classification markings revealed the following approximate numbers 184 unique documents bearing classification markings including 67 documents marked as confidential 92 documents marked as secret and 25 documents marked as top secret further the fbi agents observed markings reflecting the following compartmentsdissemination controls hcs fisa orcon noforn and si based on my training and experience i know that documents classified at these levels typically contain ndi several of the documents also contained what appears to be fpotuss handwritten notes the categories include hsc which refers to intelligence information derived from clandestine human sources and noforn which means that material is not to be released to any foreign governments or nationals the agent then quotes from a june 8 letter from the department of justice to trumps lawyers that said the classified material was not being securely controlled they have not been handled in an appropriate manner or stored in an appropriate location accordingly we ask that the room at maralago where the documents had been stored be secured and that all of the boxes that were moved from the white house to maralago along with any other items in that room be preserved in that room in their current condition until further notice the letter read much of text of the affidavit is entirely blacked out to protect the names of investigators witnesses and investigative techniques the entirety of pages 24 through 28 is just black lines except for paragraph numbers and a subheading there is probable cause to believe that documents containing classified ndi and presidential records remain at the premises doj prosecutors filed the redacted affidavit at the federal courthouse in west palm beach florida late friday morning after magistrate judge bruce reinhart ruled on thursday that he had accepted the redactions prosecutors proposed to the affidavit as narrowly tailored to serve the governments legitimate interest in the integrity of the ongoing investigation and are the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire affidavit an hour after the release of the affidavit trump posted another message on his social media network attacking the fbi the justice department and the judge in the case affidavit heavily redacted nothing mentioned on nuclear a total public relations subterfuge by the fbi doj or our close working relationship regarding document turnover we gave them much judge bruce reinhart should never have allowed the breakin of my home he wrote on truth social the former president has publicly demanded the release of the unredacted affidavit but did not make that request in court fbi agents searched trumps tennis and social club in palm beach on aug 8 and took away boxes of material including 11 packets of classified documents among that set was a batch labeled with the highest classification markings meant for review only in secure government facilities trump who had already been attacking the fbi and prosecutors for investigating his actions on and leading up to the jan 6 2021 capitol insurrection has ramped up criticism of law enforcement since then his followers have responded by threatening fbi agents and the department of justice and one trump supporter was killed in a shootout with police after he tried to attack the fbis cincinnati field office in addition to the federal criminal investigations a georgia prosecutor is separately investigating trump and his allies attempts to coerce state officials into falsely declaring him the winner in that state trump despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and 306232 in the electoral college became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully his incitement of the jan 6 assault on the capitol his lastditch attempt to remain in office killed five including one police officer injured another 140 officers and led to four police suicides nevertheless trump remains the dominant figure in the republican party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024 in statements on his personal social media platform trump has continued to lie about the election and the house jan 6 committees work calling it a hoax similar to previous investigations into his 2016

sports another nfl regular season has flown by and as the playoffs approach theres more leaguewide confusion over what constitutes a catch than ever because of a series of recent nfl catch rule changes one of the most basic commonplace plays in football has become a weekly puzzle for officials players and coaches alike the problem undoubtedly hit a tipping point this season as players and coaches avidly spoke out against seemingly weekly controversial catch calls in october detroit lions wide receiver calvin johnson told the detroit free press he thought no one in the league even understood the catch rules calvin on the nfls rules about catches i thought i understood the rule i dont think anybody does now in december recently fired philadelphia eagles head coach chip kelly flatout admitted to local radio station 94wip i dont know what a catch is the speed of the game does no favor to the officials but neither does their employers rulebook halfway through the 2015 season there were more coaches challenges to a pass completion ruling than any other play and more than half of those calls were overturned upon review the highest rate of any challenged play according to espn no catch is safe upon review with their ears to the streets the nfl decided in december to convene a catch rule committee to study the ongoing issue before marchs competition committee meeting where rule changes can be implemented on tuesday the catch rule committee held its first meeting and a group of additional warmly welcomed experts attended as well while johnson and dallas cowboys wide receiver dez bryant were not included in the first meeting despite expressing their desires to help the nfl clarify the rule many people involved closely in the game were including green bay packers wide receiver jordy nelson and legendary receivers like randy moss cris carter steve largent fred biletnikoff and tim brown speaking to the nfl network on tuesday vice president of officiating dean blandino acknowledged the problematic subjectivity of the rule before patting himself on the back for doing what the league shouldve done years ago ask the people who have actually played the game at the professional level what the rule should be what better way and what better people than former receivers we had several former receivers to look at some plays get some feedback blandino said yes what a novel idea actually asking wide receivers you know the guys doing the catching and whatnot what they think a catch is and then creating a simple rule around their lived experiences would probably bring an end to the catch crisis inclusion breeds trust and given whats transpired between receivers and the league rule book this season its wholly necessary for effective change critically using wide receiver input to evaluate the catch rule is a welcome change for the nfl presumably previous changes to the catch rule were forged behind giant steel doors atop of the nfls ivory tower on madison ave tangibly the nfls catch rule changes have only served to invalidate amazing feats of football athleticism the prime example this infamous bryant incomplete pass against the packers last january bryants subsequent outrage over the call it was a catch and they took it away caused enough of an uproar for the nfl to change the catch rule in july 2015 but instead of rewriting the rule so that bryants play would have been a gamechanging catch the league doubled down and wrote new rules to clarify that it wasnt removed was the vague language about a player having to make a football move to rubber stamp a wouldbe catch the most subjective and heavily criticized part of the catch rule in its place came equally confusing and subjective phrasing clearly establish himself as a runner replaced football move and nothings made damn sense since we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support

by a transparent nfl committee for the betterment of the league the nfl is trying to do a good thing what could go wrong everything of course to help everyone along this arduous process lets put it this way if it looks like a catch walks like a catch and talks like a catch its probably a catch

worldnews venezuela once was one of latin americas most prosperous countries the country sat on the worlds largest oil reserves according to opec without always having been a paragon of democracy far from it it was in the process of building solid institutions then came the election of former tank commander hugo chavez and later the appointment followed by a bogus election of his sorry bloodthirsty clone nicolas maduro now watch as the dream becomes a nightmare watch as a mix of incompetence and stupidity brings everything crashing down the country carved up by a grasping bolivarian oligarchy beholden to a cuba that has itself been bled dry and no longer believes in its own model watch as the tinpot liberator pumping revenues from the national oil company to finance his clientelism and to top up opaque funds managed without oversight by the satraps of the regime drops his country to the back of the pack of those headed for mass poverty with a rate of inflation to cite just one indicator rivaling that of zimbabwe or weimar germany one thinks of candides return from his land of cockaigne where gold the yellow oil flowed freely one thinks of the myth of el dorado as recounted by luis sepulveda alejo carpentier and otherswhich never ends well this particular el dorado once depleted and drained will pay a heavy price meanwhile the sacking of the country goes on against the background of a wave of violence that has put it on the verge of civil war a hundred and twenty dead in the past few weeks opposition figures persecuted dismissed kidnapped imprisoned people tortured in police stations and jails and now adding insult to injury an electoral farce that has handed maduro a deconstituent assembly with full powers to dismantle if it so chooses the countrys fragile institutional balance in the face of this disaster two questions occur to me the first reflects my french perspective but applies in one form or another to other countries of the west how long will jeanluc melenchon a contender in frances spring 2017 presidential election who now aspires to lead the opposition in france as head of the leftwing populist party whose name translates roughly as rebellious france la france insoumise continue to sing the praises of this murderous regime how many people will have to die before he calls a spade a spade and acknowledges that maduros security forces are no different from those that not long ago spread terror in chile and argentina what has to happen before melenchon will speak his consciencenot his previous alliances or his previous wordsand admit that he was wrong admit that this brutal regime was never a proper source of inspiration and acknowledge that the business about a bolivarian alliance written into article 62 of his unsuccessful presidential platform which was supposed to move him and france closer to the heirs of the dear departed caudillos castro chavez was a really bad idea for the moment he does not seem to be waiting for anything like the spaniards of podemos and the greeks of syriza like jeremy corbyn in great britain melenchon and his rebellious followers seem to believe that their hero with the bloody hands is excused by the struggle against imperialism and when they do stir it is either to blame the victims as when djordje kuzmanovic a sinister spokesman for melenchons party compared venezuelans demonstrating peacefully for democracy and the rule of law to pinochets putschists in 1970s chile or to denounce disinformation as when alexis corbire a newly elected farleft member of the national assembly layering shame over cowardice managed to insult venezuelans who died for democracy young people from fancy neighborhoods corbire implied who only got what they deserved and stigmatizing the opposition that is the target of the governments savage paramilitary militias sometimes people get burned have these selfstyled rebels been subdued or are they hostages words like those of melenchon and his confederates are unworthy of a party that wishes to be viewed as the opposition in france the second question is addressed to the international community which has at least two reasons to take an interest in venezuelas plight one of those reasons is the responsibility to protect as spelled out in the united nations charter which calls for strong signals in this case a clear condemnation from a courageous security council gestures of support such as official welcomes for opposition leaders who still enjoy freedom of movement in paris madrid and washington expressions of solidarity with the venezuelan legislature which maduros coup by constituent assembly threatens to dissolve from the diplomatic missions of france spain the united states and other nations and of course economic and financial sanctions that go beyond toothless warnings from mercosur and the timid saberrattling of donald trump a less widely known reason why the events in caracas should concern us is related to the fight against terrorism and the moneylaundering that finances it what is the purpose of the alliancesorry the bolivarian alliancethat chavez made with mahmoud ahmadinejad the former president of iran where have the members of the colombian farc disappeared to one of their leaders ivan rios told me just before his death in 2007 that farc members had been sent on a mission to the country of twentyfirst century socialism how much credence should be given to certain leaders of the antichavist opposition who are crying in the wilderness at least for now that there is more to know about maduros links with north korea bashar alassads syria and freelancing hezbollah renegades but they are questions that have to be asked experience tells us that no act is too base for a desperate regime the situation in venezuela merits commissions of inquiry a russell tribunal and greater interest from the western press rather than the embarrassed silence that so far has met what is in fact a slowmotion coup detat translated from french by steven b kennedy

worldnews a hardline antiimmigrant party is poised for a big win in swedens elections sunday seemingly signaling another dramatic shift toward the far right in europe in a historic liberal bastion the sweden democrats say their rise is because nations like theirs have been overwhelmed by foreigners particularly after more than 2 million flowed into europe since 2015 in the biggest wave of refugees since world war ii but new research suggests that line might be as misleading as the stories the partys supporters have pumped out on social media about immigrant behavior instead the partys success is strongly associated with a factor foreigners had little control over the policy choices of swedens native politicians according to a recently released paper by five economists that draws on data about sweden democrat candidates and voters the experts point to a double whammy in 2006 a new centerright government took aim at swedens famed welfare state reducing unemployment sickness and disability benefits to finance tax cuts and sparking a sharp and sustained increase in income inequality come 2008 the global financial crisis hit causing big job losses particularly among people who had already become less secure in the labor market people mostly look at the radical right from the angle of external shocks like trade with foreign workers proving cheaper than domestic ones and globalization the point that you might take away from our paper is the effect of austerity policy said johanna rickne one of the coauthors of the report and a professor at stockholm university the first election after the events the researchers focus on held in 2010 marked the first time the sweden democrats scored enough votes to enter swedens parliament in the next election they more than doubled their vote share what the party relied on the researchers show was the increasing pain of outsiders people primarily workingclass men with lower levels of education who had little stable employment and relied heavily on government benefits the sweden democrats also attracted particular vulnerable insiders whose jobs were especially likely to be outsourced or otherwise obliterated by the market perhaps because of technological change those groups of relative economic losers also provided a disproportionately high number of the partys electoral candidates compared with swedens other parties the result was that the two groups became tightly tied to a foreignerbashing party that had been around but was not a major force since 1988 after emerging from neonazi circles if you are yourself doing worse and worse relative to others and your income is stagnating or even declining year after year compared to people with stable employment people are prone to thinking immigrants are taking resources rather than understanding tax and spending policy rickne said in the years since swedens economy has become one of the fastestgrowing in europe swedes who are insiders have done better and better but inequality has continued to flourish and so have the sweden democrats the countrys top parties on the centerleft and centerright have shown little interest in reconsidering the tax cuts package of 2006 or other steps toward expanded redistribution even the social spending promises of the main liberal party the social democrats focus on universal benefits rather than those targeted at say the outsiders that seeming callousness and the economic changes in the first place are the reason many voters became distrustful and were inspired to thumb their nose at the swedish establishment with that as a priority those voters respected the sweden democrats determination to criticize politicians general consensus on welcoming immigrants the paper argues perceiving that as a way to tackle swedens own elites as much as or perhaps more than foreigners the often harsh and targeted rhetoric matters then but not just because of voters racial animus voters have stuck with the party as it has focused on immigration restrictions saying little about reversing the policies of the mid2000s and instead adopting standard fiscally conservative talk about the value of tax cuts and arguing having fewer immigrants will preserve the welfare state and the researchers found that those groups continued support for the sweden democrats does not seem linked to direct exposure to immigrants or demographic changes in their own communities sound familiar other developed economies that are growing richer but also more unequal have seen similar developments a different study released this year found links between politically imposed austerity in the united kingdom and support for the immigrantbaiting party that promoted brexit the paper notes in finland a radical right party has made gains after painful spending cuts even though the country has experienced minuscule amounts of immigration factors other than economic anxiety remain central to the popularity and conduct of antiimmigrant parties like the sweden democrats our paper doesnt provide 100 percent of the explanation rickne said but its attracting attention in sweden and abroad and has undeniable value in showing what rival politicians and others upset about the hardrights growth need to understand and address i find their results interesting and intuitively reasonable niklas bolin of mid sweden university told huffpost in an email noting that the study departs from much other research directly tying increased antiimmigration views to increased support for the far right a central question that remains is whether voters like these support parties because they purport to be antiestablishment by departing from elite views on immigration or other issues or if economic insecurity directly makes people more likely to decide they are upset about foreigners one plausible hypothesis is that those voters who are economically less welloff also are more receptive to antiimmigration

economy washington ap the federal reserve signaled its confidence wednesday in the us economy by raising a key interest rate for a third time this year forecasting another rate hike before years end and predicting that it will continue to tighten credit into 2020 to manage growth and inflation the fed lifted its shortterm rate a benchmark for many consumer and business loans by a modest quarterpoint to a range of 2 percent to 225 percent it was its eighth hike since late 2015 the central bank also stuck with a previous forecast for three more rate hikes in 2019 in a statement after its latest policy meeting the fed dropped phrasing it had long used that characterized its policy as accommodative that is favoring low rates the fed had used variations of that pledge in the seven years that it kept its key rate at a record low near zero and over the past nearly three years in which its gradually tightened credit by removing that language the fed may be signaling its resolve to keep raising rates in a news conference after its meeting though chairman jerome powell said the removal of the accommodative language did not amount to a policy change our economy is strong powell declared at the start of his news conference growth is running at a healthy clip unemployment is low the number of people working is rising steadily and wages are up inflation is low and stable all of these are very good signs the chairman added though thats not to say everything is perfect the benefits of this strong economy have not reached all americans many of our countrys economic challenges are beyond the scope of the fed the feds actions and its updated economic forecasts wednesday had been widely anticipated initially there was little reaction in the stock or bond markets but later in the afternoon stocks sold off and major indexes closed modestly lower the fed stuck to script today pushing ahead with another rate hike said michael pearce senior us economist at capital economics but pearce added our view is that officials are still underestimating just how quickly the economy is likely to lose momentum next year he said he expects the fed to suspend its rate hikes by mid2019 and then feel compelled to cut rates by early 2020 to support the economy in its updated outlook wednesday the fed foresees one final rate hike after 2019 in 2020 which would leave its benchmark at 34 percent at that point it would regard its policy as modestly restraining growth the fed seeks to slow the economy when it reaches full employment to prevent a tight job market from raising inflation too high during a lateafternoon news conference in new york president donald trump said he was not happy about the feds latest rate hike in a highly unusual move for a president trump has publicly complained that the feds rate increases could blunt his efforts to boost growth through tax cuts and deregulation earlier powell said during his news conference that such outside criticism would have no effect on the feds use of rates to try to maximize employment and stabilize prices weve been given a really important job to do on behalf of the american people powell said my colleagues and i are focused exclusively on carrying out that mission the feds latest forecast predicts that the unemployment rate now 39 percent will reach 37 percent by the end of this year and then 35 percent next year not since the late 1960s has unemployment fallen that low the central bank expects unemployment to begin rising to 37 percent at the end of 2021 it foresees the economy growing 31 percent this year before slowing to 25 percent in 2019 2 percent in 2020 and 18 percent in 2021 the fed sees the economys longrun growth at a 18 percent annual rate far below the trump administrations projections for a sustained rate of 3 percent many analysts think the economy could weaken next year in part from the effects of the trade conflicts trump has pursued with china canada europe and other trading partners the tariffs trump has imposed on imported steel and chinese goods in particular complicate the feds decisionmaking thats because the tariffs and the resulting retaliation from americas trading partners could weaken the us economy the fed would normally respond to weaker growth by cutting interest rates but tariffs which are an import tax can inflate prices and the fed typically counters higher inflation by raising rates megan greene global chief economist at manulife asset management said she thought the tariffs were more likely to slow the economy than to accelerate inflation the real risk of trade wars greene wrote last week is a hit to growth not a boost to inflation indeed the feds regional banks have reported that some businesses are delaying investments until they see some resolution to the trade hostilities in his news conference powell said some companies have told fed officials that the tariffs have raised fears that supply chains will be disrupted and raw materials will cost more we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers

said he had yet to see evidence that the administrations tariffs have raised prices for many consumers but he said rising inflation remains a threat resulting from trumps trade policies its a concern powell said its a risk you could see prices moving up you dont see it yet but you could see retail prices moving up the tariffs might provide a basis for companies to raise prices in a world where theyve been very reluctant to and unable to raise prices

neither side will go away anytime soon and alex trembath policy analyst with the breakthrough institute a california think tank calling for a new ecomodernism that rethinks traditional environmentalist ideology and rejects the idea that man is ruining nature as industry officials and employees sat and listened more than a few raised their eyebrows at what they heard on the stage before them as speakers ushered in the era of cooperation even harmony with conservationists meeting fractivists in the middle and finding common ground the emphasis at the conference was to change the nature of the dialogue away from an usvsthem framework to one where we acknowledge that we are all in this together coga president and ceo tisha schuller said in an email response to questions we all use energy and the products of energy we all want to protect our family our community and our colorado natural environment polarization becomes a selffulfilling prophecy where we expect conflict and so further exacerbate the situation meeting in the middle is complex time consuming trying and messy but ultimately it is the only way to get anything worthwhile accomplished while the industry has grown in the last couple of years and helped colorado pull out of the great recession residents have become increasingly skeptical as they organize through social networking some organizing

competitive industry has been reticent to reveal lest lose an advantage residents worry about those chemicals seeping into ground water they show videos of fugitive emissions pouring from tank batteries polluting the air theyve called for action and want sound scientific proof the industry does not harm the environment or people as the industry encroaches more on urban neighborhoods and schools while the industry has attempted to answer the myriad questions surrounding their activities that have been ongoing in weld county for 40 years without dangerous health effects theyve faced increasing skepticism and stricter regulations most recently the colorado oil and gas conservation commission placed tighter setback rules for locating drilling activities near buildings the state air

social according to a recent new york times piece that has stirred a highly emotional debate among my many colleagues parents across the us who once felt confident helping their children with homework until high school are now feeling helpless when confronted with their firstgraders common corealigned work sheets stoked by viral postings online that ridicule math homework in which students are asked to critique a phantom childs thinking or engage in complex steps in computational thinking along with mockery from comedians including louis c k and stephen colbert these parents are now adding their voices to a charged political debate about whether the common core is an effective measure of learning or just another way in which washington is taking over our lives at the organization i lead the joan ganz cooney center weve recently dipped our toes into the rollicking debate over rigorous standards and accountability systems while i am personally a keen supporter of creating more rigorous national standards there are four big challenges that are not getting nearly enough attention in the public debate first the new standards are out of tune with many of the job skills employers are demanding and wont fulfill new needs for engaged healthy problemsolvers in a global age traditionally state level assessments in the us have been focused on discrete and narrow cognitive skills at single points in time and for high stakes the common core state standards are a major improvement on the breadth vs depth issue but it remains to be seen if other key approaches to lifelong learning such as problemsolving teamwork tenacity and healthy habits will be measured by anyone we should learn lessons from early childhood educators who place emphasis on developing a whole child as a key principle of practice we should also pay closer attention to experts such as angela duckworth the partnership for global learning and casel who are experimenting with both classroom and whole school redesigns to promote a new emotionally intelligent globally oriented youth force as well as highly promising video game products developed by pioneers such as trip hawkins of madden football and fifa fame richie davidson and debra lieberman who are promoting socioemotional and executive functioning skills and healthy lifestyles in a thoroughly modern way bottom line these leaders are helping schools and youth to build a new skill set that will help kids compete as well as cooperate they are committed to youth who are smarter and also stronger and kinder second the high stakes weve come to expect as policy and practice drivers are a real bummer for many kids teachers and schools a better way to frame the national conversation on assessment is to take stock of how many global competitors view assessment as a lever for program improvement as henry roediger recently wrote in the new york times testing new learning within the context of regular classwork and study routines has been proven to help students retain new knowledge in the smartest kids in the world amanda ripley suggests that we should build in much more frequent assessments for lowerstakes accountability that is focused on cascading competencies that will then be demonstrated on the higherstakes and less frequent assessments the plain fact is that since the link between student and teacher performance is often tied contractually to highstakes testing the energies of too many great teachers are being sapped another unintended outcome from the high stakes so many lowachieving youth are turning away from a pathway forward there are alternatives like badging systems and more authentic portfolios that should be prioritized for largescale experimentation third the incentives to celebrate success around assessment are currently distorted while additional payforperformance approaches do create incentives for individual teachers to raise student achievement these schemes do not typically drive additional support to a unit when academic success is measuredschools as a whole often simply avoid punishment simply put we do a lousy job of rewarding success assessments have become a game for individuals and not for the entire learning community enter the prospect of gamebased learning as a new element within a more playful wholechild communitycentered approach through the games and learning publishing council and our new website gamesandlearningorg a group of national organizations and practitioners is looking at the possible role that digital games aka video games may play in documenting and encouraging deeper learning and higher performance what about games are really good for in learning games have driven learning and social communication for millennia when designed well they have three great benefits they are fun to play they offer tough mental and physical challenges and they have great social currencythey add to the conversation good games allow personalization and rigor celebrate persistence and grit and discourage longterm failure and they offer challenges that a whole school state or nation can encounter together good games give instant feedback and can build community norms for high performance research on games learning and healthy development are still in the early stages with gamesandlearningorg we aim to keep up with the flow of research and investment in this growing sector for those concerned with assessment the relevant question is how to reinvent classrooms to meet the needs of todays students and educators there is a great deal of evidence that projectbased learning approaches that integrate modern technologies are gaining momentumin strong charter networks such as high tech high rocketship and kipp and in new startups such as quest2learn and the incubator school in los angeles these models are often using games and technology to challenge traditional approacheswhether it is flipping classrooms changing the roles of teachers or reconfiguring staffing structures to promote success new forms of assessment that take advantage of embedded gamebased tools may be on the rise in a recent national survey of k8 teachers the cooney center found a significant appetite for using games in nontraditional ways for example almost 6 out of 10 of the teachers surveyed said that they used builtin assessments in games to make instructional decisions and over half said that builtin assessment systems helped them judge their students mastery of key content at the endofcurriculum units many teachers use what they learn from the games assessment tools to modify their own teaching choosing to emphasize areas where students struggled and condensing material that they already understand and nearly half use games to teach supplementary content not mandated by their schools or districts nonetheless perhaps the biggest and our fourth challenge for those interested in gamebased assessment as a true driver of performance is in a professional preparation gap teachers cannot teach with modern tools that they themselves dont understand in a previous national survey of teachers that the cooney center conducted in 2012 very few had any training in the use of games in the classroom and more than forty percent pointed to the need for professional development as the most pressing need in integrating new technologies well gamebased learning is not a magic elixir to pressing student engagement and performance challenges but games are an overlooked ally in the fundamental rethinking we must do to ensure that the common core and other 21st century skills are in fact addressed in the next five years their unique advantage is the passionate embrace games get from one of the most overlooked success drivers for lasting improvement the youth themselves we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly

politics the senate on tuesday passed a bill to expand health care and disability benefits to millions of veterans less than a week after more than two dozen republicans blocked it and drew outrage from the veterans community comedian jon stewart and others the promise to address comprehensive toxics act or the pact act passed in a 8611 vote it now heads to president joe bidens desk to be signed into law it should have passed the senate last week a similar version of the pact act passed the senate in june in an 8414 vote its not particularly controversial it would allow soldiers sailors and airmen exposed to pits of burnt waste in combat zones to be covered by the veterans affairs health care system for related illnesses many of these vets got sick from exposure to burn pits during the afghanistan and iraq wars but last wednesday right after the news broke that sen joe manchin dwva and senate majority leader chuck schumer dny had struck a deal on a massive tax and climate change package 25 republicans unexpectedly blocked the pact act despite previously voting to advance it it made no sense except in the context of republicans having a fullblown tantrum about a democratic deal they didnt like and taking out their anger on a totally unrelated veterans bill sen pat toomey rpa led the gop effort to block the bill saying he wanted to add an amendment related to budgetary spending the gop vote to block the bill spurred veterans to show up outside the capitol in protest some of whom had been camped outside of the building for days stewart who has advocated on behalf of veterans for years joined them and tore into republicans as stabvetsintheback senators if this is america first then america is fucked stewart fumed but on tuesday republicans folded and agreed to move forward on the bill on the condition that they could get votes on three gop amendments sen rand paul rky wanted to reduce aid to other countries to help pay for the pact act toomey wanted to classify funding for the pact act as discretionary versus mandatory sen marsha blackburn rtenn wanted to shift veterans care into private community care just before the bill passed sen jon tester dmont the bills sponsor tweeted a video of stewart hugging him and thanking him outside the capitol for getting the bill done my man pots and pans stewart shouted at tester you brought this thing through and you made this happen he said walking with his arm around the senator and these guys know that and they appreciate it
economy trader joes announced that it has been working on repackaging its international food products for several years after a widespread petition called out the grocery chain out for their racist branding and packaging a petition created earlier this month took aim at trader joes ethnic foods and noted that they belie a narrative of exoticism that perpetuates harmful stereotypes for example trader mings is used to brand the chains chinese food arabian joe brands middle eastern foods trader jose brands mexican foods trader giottos is for italian food and trader joe san brands their japanese cuisine reads the petition the trader joes branding is racist because it exoticizes other cultures it presents joe as the default normal and the other characters falling outside of it they are arabian joe trader jose and trader joe san the petition also took issue with the chains founder joe coulombe taking inspiration in building the trader joes brand from a racist book and a controversial theme park attraction both of which have received criticism for romanticizing western imperialism and fetishizing nonwestern peoples the petition points to the chains website which claims coulombe was inspired by the book white shadows in the south seas and the disneyland jungle trip ride spokesperson kenya frienddaniel told npr on monday that the brand made the decision several years ago to use only the trader joes name on our products moving forward and had hoped that the work would be complete by now but there are still a small number of products going through the packaging change and we expect to be done very soon frienddaniel also told the publication that repackaging had been in progress before the petition and was not in response to it she said the controversial approach to naming may have been rooted in a lighthearted attempt at inclusiveness however frienddaniel said we recognize that it may now have the opposite effect one that is contrary to the welcoming rewarding customer experience we strive to create every day in a statement to cbs news the brand added while this approach to product naming may have been rooted in a lighthearted attempt at inclusiveness we recognize that it may now have the opposite effect one that is contrary to the welcoming rewarding customer experience we strive to create every day while many of the offending product packaging has already been changed according to the brand trader joes also told the publication they plan to finish changing over all packaging very soon trader joes did not respond to huffposts request for comment the chain is one of many who has been faced with reassessing their brands racist history andor marketing in the wake of the police killing of george floyd and nationwide protests against racial inequality in america brands like aunt jemima uncle bens cream of wheat mrs butterworth and more have reevaluated their names mascots and imagery to not perpetuate racism and stereotypes
entertainment cooking with parmesan parmigiano reggiano to be more precise generally involves grating the cheese into flakes or planing it into thin sheets that mostly covers the traditional ground of adding it to dishes before theyre cooked and garnishing them at the last minute it doesnt cover one of the best ways to use it eating it plain pried off a wedge to form craggy little chunks and served at room temperature with a glass of wine some would drip a drop of longaged balsamic vinegar onto it but i like my parmesan the way the dairy delivered it it needs no enhancement sometimes especially if there are other snacks on the table a few chunks remain uneaten these leftovers usually get grated or snacked upon but the other day i was looking at a small handful of the nuggets as i considered what to do with a quarter pound or so 115 g of regular white mushrooms uncooked themselves left over from another dish the rest of dinner was pretty well set and one way or another the mushrooms would be a side dish a tiny side dish once theyd cooked down the umamiuponumami addition of leftover parmesan to leftover mushrooms seemed a good way to make the dish so flavorful that its meager size would become irrelevant every bite would pack a punch it would have been a simple matter to saute the mushrooms then grate the cheese over them perhaps adding some fried breadcrumbs for crunch but i got to wondering how the brokenup pieces of parmesan would take to being cooked whole after all when ive simmered parmesan rind in sauces this adds lots of flavor try it next time you make tomato sauce the cheese has grown softer without collapsing perhaps something similar would happen worth a try whatever transpired it would taste good so i quartered the mushrooms and cooked them in butter over gentle heat seasoned with salt and pepper and a thinly sliced shallot first to drive off excess water then to brown them slightly i didnt cook them so long that they shriveled or dried out when they were just about done i added the parmesan chunks and some thyme leaves dropped the heat to low and stirred until the cheese was heated through and had stopped being crumbly about two minutes the cheese behaved just as i thought it would it was hot and moderately soft but it retained its integrity and lost not a whit of its flavor the mushrooms their own flavor concentrated by cooking held up very well and the ensemble was as intense as planned a good little side dish parmesan chunks used in this way have a lot of potential with other vegetables oilbraised greens for instance and even for certain soups imagine pasta e fagioli in which beansized pieces of parmesan turn up unexpectedly in your spoon
economy los angeles tony rosado sits in the silent back room of el mercado with a giant stack of papers piled in front of him on a sturdy wooden table the papers are part of his appeals to stop the construction of lorena plaza a 49unit supportive housing complex that has been proposed for an empty parcel of land next to his market in this historically latino neighborhood east of downtown why in boyle heights he asked i dare you to go try and build this in beverly hills it would never get through el mercado which rosado took over after his father died in 2014 is a threestory restaurant and market packed with stalls of vendors or puestos selling cowboy boots communion dresses religious paraphernalia tubs of obscure moles and dried sweets boyle heights is one of the most heavily latino communities in the city and el mercado is its vibrant nerve center lorena plaza is one of the complexes that nonprofit developers have proposed to house the 58000 people experiencing homelessness in los angeles voters approved a 2017 ballot measure calling for a 12 billion bond to fund permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless but where exactly that housing should go has proven a much more difficult question boyle heights is known citywide for its residents vigorous antigentrification efforts theyve fought to keep richer whiter transplants from encroaching on their territory in a sense rosados fight to keep housing for the homeless out of his neighborhood is part of the same struggle for agency rosado says lorena street isnt the right place for housing for the homeless el mercado gets busy on the weekends and cars zoom down lorena street and into the parking lot a metro train line also runs nearby to put a sensitive population so close to a busy cultural center and next to exposed railroad tracks rosado said i dont think thats the right thing to do the rosado family has been fighting lorena plaza for years they filed an environmental appeal with the citys planning and land use management committee in may 2017 citing uncapped oil wells on the property that could present a danger to residents if they leaked the family found a sympathetic ear with councilmember jose huizar who approved their appeal in the committee and stalled construction until a full environmental review was conducted housing developers and other critics claim such resistance pits communities against the will of citywide voters in an open letter to huizar during the appeal meetings las top nonprofit developers argued that the appeal would deny los angeles voters the mandate and action they overwhelmingly supported we all care and we all want to eradicate homelessness said janet kim a los feliz resident and member of a multineighborhood homelessness task force selah neighborhood homeless coalition that includes residents from silver lake echo park los feliz atwater village and hollywood the problem she said is that people are on the fence about how were going to do that this concern isnt limited to boyle heights residents of venice a wealthy white oceanside neighborhood where companies like snap inc google youtube and vice have mutated the community into a postgentrification business district of sorts have also fought plans to build housing for the homeless suburbanites in leafy pleasant temple city have successfully stalled the redevelopment of a motel that was planned for supportive housing property owners in lincoln heights are also rallying against a handful of housing proposals five is too many reads the mission statement of the coalition to protect lincoln heights still rosado thinks his situation in boyle heights is different from other conflicts around the city residents here feel their voices have been ignored and say community outreach was inadequate for this kind of development a community of friends the nonprofit developer seeking to build lorena plaza seems surprised by the backlash in the past 30 years acof has built 42 supportive housing complexes in the city without much controversy the word i would use to describe us was stealth said dora leong gallo acofs director we built the buildings we operated and moved people in and nobody was the wiser people ask if this is a brandnew thing like weve never done it before thats not quite true gallo knows better than most the complexities of building units in a city historically constrained by rigid planning laws and acof usually navigates the process well but the lorena plaza development has been particularly difficult gallo believes the rosados environmental appeal was disingenuous the opposition to lorena plaza stems from stereotypes of the homeless she argued pointing to the rosados initial appeals the late pedro rosado told a metro board hearing in 2013 that he was very appalled how people are not mentioning that in this facility they are trying to bring mentally ill people to put our children at risk boyle heights was already primed for a fight over development nonlocal artists have been opening new galleries here like 356 mission and bbq la which attracted the ire of activistresidents last year weird wave brewers a coffee shop owned by two white men and a latino man none of whom live in boyle heights opened on cesar chavez avenue prompting concerns that the neighboring arts district which is demographically wealthier whiter and younger was trickling into the barrio rosado argues that the city is taking advantage of the mostly spanishspeaking lowincome residents of boyle heights and that other neighborhoods would never have to fight so hard to keep out a proposal like this they would lobby their representatives and then bombard their offices with calls he said they would pull all their financial support for their campaigns if their representatives were allowing these types of projects to get through he suggested that people experiencing homelessness be housed on the outskirts of the city where its not the whitecollar people that are affected or the bluecollar on march 6 the la city council held a final vote on the lorena plaza environmental appeal dozens of supporters of the project identified by fluorescent yellow stickers that said lorena plaza supporter packed the aisles of city halls chambers there did not appear to be any critics of the development present the rosado family was not in attendance but their lawyer read aloud a statement arguing that the city is responsible for investigating the environmental concerns thoroughly and urging the council to pursue a new assessment acofs gallo also addressed the council telling them her organization has remained optimistic and steadfast in our belief that this is a good project at a good location and reasonable people who care about the state of homelessness in los angeles can successfully negotiate a solution huizar the councilmember raised concerns about community involvement in the proposal its not an issue of nimbyism or against permanent supportive housing its an issue about community process building trust no matter what youre building whether its a retail center permanent supportive housing commercial he said whatever it is there needs to be trust between the applicant the developer and the local community and thats what was lacking here yet huizar recommended that his colleagues deny the appeal and allow acof to build lorena plaza then the council cast its vote thirteen in favor of allowing the development to go forward and zero opposed gallo said she was pleased with the result especially huizars aboutface its a pretty incredible feeling to have him change his mind because its hard and he does want what is best for his community and i recognize that she said gallo expects to break ground in fall 2019 with a completion date toward the end of 2020 tony rosado said he is disappointed but isnt backing down yet were going to continue fighting it he said were going to pursue our legal options in a statement to huffpost huizar said the developer has agreed to complete the necessary environmental review and will ensure the soil is clean he also emphasized the importance of community involvement as the city seeks housing solutions for people experiencing homelessness as we unroll our efforts to construct permanent supportive housing throughout the city we need to be completely honest with the public from the outset and throughout the approval processes he said that doesnt mean everyone will be happy with every project but unlike this process at least well all be clear about what is being proposed on april 5 rosado filed suit against the city of los angeles alleging that environmental law had been broken the writ submitted by rosados lawyers asks for the citys decision to be vacated in lieu of a full environmental review it also asks for the suspension of the authority of city and city council to grant any authority permits or entitlements as part of the project until

worldnews as other members of the british royal family are carefully making inperson appearances postlockdown queen elizabeths reemergence on the public stage looks to be some time off the monarch recently made the trek to balmoral her estate in scotland for her annual summer stay which typically covers most of august and september but instead of returning to buckingham palace in london afterward as she normally would the sunday times recently reported that the queen will most likely head back to windsor castle outside the city amid the chaos and uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic the palace communications team has reassured the public that the queen is doing well through radio and tv addresses photos of her riding her horses and a glimpse here and there of the sovereign on a video call but its no doubt hard for the monarch who once said she must be seen to be believed to remain isolated from the public and many royal fans want to know when will they see the queen again the 94yearold queen began quarantining at windsor castle alongside the 99yearold prince philip in march arriving a week earlier than normal due to the pandemic by may royal biographer andrew morton declared that covid19 had rendered her reign effectively over its terribly sad but i cant see how the queen can resume her job he told the telegraph as reports swirled that elizabeth would be withdrawing from public life for months and prince charles would be named prince regent a title he would only assume while the queen was still alive the covid19 virus isnt going away soon and will be with us for months if not years morton said the brutal truth is that her reign is effectively over he added covid19 has done more damage to the monarchy than oliver cromwell at the time buckingham palace told huffpost the queen continues to be busy and will follow appropriate advice on engagements though it might seem like this particular pandemic could prematurely end queen elizabeths reign the monarchy has survived worse carolyn harris author of raising royalty 1000 years of royal parenting who also runs royalhistoriancom notes that british royalty has been through public health crises before call it another annus horribilis there have been monarchs in the past who have reigned during periods of plague and pandemic harris told huffpost pointing to king edward iii who lost three of his dozen children to the black death plague in the mid14th century in the early 1660s there were numerous outbreaks of plague in restoration london especially the great plague of 1665 during the reign of charles ii she said which drove the king and his court out of the city for months for centuries the monarch has faced the challenge of acting as a unifying force while remaining in comparative seclusion during times of plague and pandemic said harris windsor castle hardly represents a flight from the queens duties either harris said it is a place that symbolizes the continuity of the monarchy over the past thousand years windsor castle has existed since the norman conquest though it has been renovated and rebuilt many times since then most recently after the fire of 1992 and the reigning dynasty also took its name from the castle in 1917 the author noted harris predicts that one of the queens first public engagements again will be coronavirusrelated and deal with essential workers just like prince william prince charles and camilla duchess of cornwalls first events out of quarantine the queen will probably meet with health care workers and other first responders to thank them for their efforts during the pandemic she said the queen may also want to meet with individuals who contracted the illness and recovered in order to hear about their experiences throughout the past few months weve heard little about the queens own experience with the pandemic and only seen one inperson event when she knighted capt tom moore at windsor but william hanson etiquette coach and executive director of the english manner described it as a sign of sacrifice that elizabeth has limited her inperson engagements and carried on without a word of public complaint by the queen scaling back her commitments making big changes to her lifestyle she once again sets the tone for the nations over which she reigns he said if the sovereign can make personal sacrifices and not see her family and friends without grumbling so can the rest of us while its unlikely that the queen will return to buckingham palace before the end of the year the sunday times expects that she will still head to her sandringham estate for the christmas holiday if the queen needs any guidance as to what she should say in her annual christmas address this year she can look for inspiration from her famous annus horribilis speech in 1992 the year in which a fire destroyed 115 rooms in windsor castle sarah duchess of york was caught in a toesucking scandal and the queens three oldest children announced they were separating from or divorcing their spouses that november the queen said 1992 is not a year on which i shall look back with undiluted pleasure in the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents it has turned out to be an annus horribilis i suspect that i am not alone in thinking it so indeed i suspect that there are very few people or institutions unaffected by these last months of worldwide turmoil and uncertainty in the meantime as hugo vickers a broadcaster royal biographer and author of the crown dissected told huffpost it is important to take as many precautions as possible to safeguard the health of the queen and the duke of edinburgh not just because theyre royal but because theyre in a vulnerable age group under normal circumstances we would not be wondering why two nonagenarians were living quietly he said adding that the queen should not emerge until it is known that it is safe and that may be a long time off
politics kyrsten sinema the arizona democrat who singlehandedly thwarted her partys longtime goal of raising taxes on wealthy investors received nearly 1 million over the past year from private equity professionals hedge fund managers and venture capitalists whose taxes would have increased under the plan for years democrats have promised to raise taxes on such investors who pay a significantly lower rate on their earnings than ordinary workers but just as they closed in on that goal last week sinema forced a series of changes to her partys 740 billion electionyear spending package eliminating a proposed carried interest tax increase on private equity earnings while securing a 35 billion exemption that will spare much of the industry from a separate tax increase other huge corporations now have to pay the bill with sinemas alterations intact was given final approval by congress on friday and is expected to be signed by president joe biden next week sinema has long aligned herself with the interests of private equity hedge funds and venture capital helping her net at least 15 million in campaign contributions since she was elected to the house a decade ago but the 983000 she has collected since last summer more than doubled what the industry donated to her during all of her preceding years in congress combined according to an associated press review of campaign finances disclosures the donations which make sinema one of the industrys top beneficiaries in congress serve a reminder of the way that highpower lobbying campaigns can have dramatic implications for the way legislation is crafted particularly in the evenly divided senate where there are no democratic votes to spare they also highlight a degree of political risk for sinema whose unapologetic defense of the industrys favorable tax treatment is viewed by many in her party as indefensible from their vantage point its a million dollars very well spent said dean baker a senior economist at the center for economic and policy research a liberalleaning think tank its pretty rare you see this direct of a return on your investment so i guess i would congratulate them sinemas office declined to make her available for an interview hannah hurley a sinema spokesperson acknowledged the senator shares some of the industrys views on taxation but rebuffed any suggestion that the donations influenced her thinking senator sinema makes every decision based on one criteria whats best for arizona hurley said in a statement she has been clear and consistent for over a year that she will only support tax reforms and revenue options that support arizonas economic growth and competitiveness the american investment council a trade group that lobbies on behalf of private equity also defended their push to defeat the tax provisions our team worked to ensure that members of congress from both sides of the aisle understand how private equity directly employs workers and supports small businesses throughout their communities drew maloney the organizations ceo and president said in a statement sinemas defense of the tax provisions offer a jarring contrast to her background as a green party activist and selfstyled prada socialist who once likened accepting campaign cash to bribery and later called for big corporations the rich to pay their fair share shortly before launching her first campaign for congress in 2012 shes been far more magnanimous since praising private equity in 2016 from the house floor for providing billions of dollars each year to main street businesses and later interning at a private equity moguls boutique winery in northern california during the 2020 congressional recess the soaring contributions from the industry to sinema trace back to last summer thats when she first made clear that she wouldnt support a carried interest tax increase as well as other corporate and business tax hikes included in an earlier iteration of bidens agenda during a twoweek period in september alone sinema collected 47100 in contributions from 16 highranking officials from the private equity firm welsh carson anderson stowe records show employees and executives of kkr another private equity behemoth contributed 44100 to sinema during a twomonth span in late 2021 in some cases the families of private equity managers joined in david belluck a partner at the firm riverside partners gave a 5800 maxout contribution to sinema one day in late june so did three of his collegeage kids with the family collectively donating 23200 records show i generally support centrist democrats and her seat is important to keep a democratic senate majority belluck said adding that his family has known sinema since her election to congress she and i have never discussed private equity taxation the donations from the industry coincide with a 26 million lobbying effort spearheaded by the investment firm blackstone that culminated on the senate floor last weekend by the time the bill was up for debate during a marathon series of votes sinema had already forced democrats to abandon their carried interest tax increase senator sinema said she would not vote for the bill unless we took it out senate majority leader chuck schumer told reporters last week we had no choice but after private equity lobbyists discovered a provision in the bill that would have subjected many of them to a separate 15 corporate minimum tax they urgently pressed sinema and other centrist democrats for changes according to emails as well as four people with direct knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations given the breaking nature of this development we need as many offices as possible weighing in with concerns to leader schumers office blackstone lobbyist ryan mcconaghy wrote in a saturday afternoon email obtained by the ap which included proposed language for modifying the bill would you and your boss be willing to raise the alarm on this and express concerns with schumer and team mcconaghy did not respond to a request for comment sinema worked with republicans on an amendment that stripped the corporate tax increase provisions from the bill which a handful of vulnerable democrats also voted for since she has been in congress kyrsten has consistently supported progrowth policies that encourage job creation across arizona her tax policy positions and focus on growing arizonas economy and competitiveness are longstanding and well known hurley the sinema spokesperson said but many in her party disagree they say the favorable treatment does little to boost the overall economy and argue theres little compelling evidence to suggest the tax benefits are enjoyed beyond some of the wealthiest investors some of sinemas donors make their case blackstone a significant source of campaign contributions owns large tracts of real estate in sinemas home state arizona the firm was condemned by united nations experts in 2019 who said blackstones financial model was responsible for a financialization of housing that has driven up rents and home costs pushing lowincome and increasingly middleincome people from their homes blackstone employees executives and their family members have given sinema 44000 since 2018 records show in a statement blackstone called the allegations by the un experts false and misleading and said all employee contributions are strictly personal the firm added that it was incredibly proud of its investments in housing another major financial services donor is centerbridge partners a new yorkbased firm that buys up the debt of distressed governments and companies and often uses hardball tactics to extract value since 2017 sinema has collected at least 29000 from donors associated with the firm including cofounder mark gallogly and his wife elizabeth strickler records show in 2012 centerbridge partners purchased arizonabased restaurant chain pf changs for roughly 1 billion after loading the struggling company up with 675 million of debt they sold it to another private equity group in 2019 according to bloomberg news the company received a 10 million coronavirus aid loan to cover payroll but shed jobs and closed locations as it struggled with the pandemic centerbridge partners was also part of a consortium of hedge funds that helped usher

social writing credit coauthored by lakshmi a mobicip blogger who is just as passionately opinionated about the juxtaposition of technology parenting and education introduction of any new tool into academia is a matter of great interest among educators students and parents this is particularly evident when the tool is technology and the domain of academia is the school the drive to develop technologyassisted classrooms has been driven by the goal of providing easy access to information coupled with the need to prepare children for a techintensive future the introduction of technology into the classroom eventually hinges on the skills attitudes and belief systems of the facilitator the teacher teachers already shoulder tremendous responsibilities they have to be impartial and objective judges of students with insights into their needs and progress in addition to understanding expectations from parents and following the norms and rules that govern them thus the equation of education is already intricate and the addition of a new variable technology into this equation not only complicates it further but raises many questions and doubts understandably no academic advancement in the history of humankind has ever elicited as much controversy as the use of technology in the classroom and both sides of the debate have legitimate points of view there are teachers who swear by technology and there are those that must be dragged kicking and screaming into a techenabled classroom most teachers however fall in the intermediate region where they are still testing the waters as seen from their responses following the issue of laptops to all students and teachers by the government of maine the to tech or not to tech controversy is fueled by conflicting reports the research at the university of southern maine found that math performance of seventh and eighthgraders taught by teachers trained in using the laptops improved significantly in another survey by the advanced placement ap and national writing project nwp most teachers reported that digital technologies helped them in teaching middle school and high school students but the distractions of the internet mobile phones and social media were challenges to deal with in contrast another review by the education department in 2009 on online courses offered to millions of k12 students found that there is lack scientific evidence of their effectiveness the ayesayers visualize a classroom where the teacher is a guide rather than the dispenser of information who nudges the students into the path of selfpaced learning through internetconnected devices the detractors are apprehensive mostly because of the need for time and resources to train or doubts in their ability to master available technology a 2010 survey by grunwald associates shows that despite more and more new teachers entering academia with far more advanced technology skills than senior teachers who have been in the field from much before the tech boom only 39 percent of teachers report moderate or frequent use of technology as an instructional tool the disparity in tech use in schools is also related to the financial stratum to which the school belongs 70 percent of teachers working in high income areas found schools good in providing them with resources and support needed to incorporate digital tools in the classroom compared to only 50 percent of teachers working in the lowest income areas as reported by the pew internet research project with the digital revolution spreading its wings into all aspects of society its inroads into academia are unavoidable it is therefore essential that teachers be prepared both mentally and skillwise in the use of technology in the classroom in order to be techsavvy a teacher must first be aware of the fine line between the use and abuse of technology for instance asking why is the first step towards becoming an efficient techenabled teacher flexibility to new knowledge and skill willingness to change an open mind set enthusiasm and genuine concern are traits that follow the first why for a teacher to ease into technologypowered education it is important for her to understand that technology can create an equitable and efficient system that supports both teaching and learning it is also a universal language transcending geographic cultural and professional barriers technology enhanced learning can accommodate the diverse learning styles of students and enable them to work in ways that are not possible in conventional classroom instruction eg flexible learning personalized pacing etc technology can improve educational productivity by accelerating the rate of learning because of absence of time boundaries and can thus utilize teacher time better beyond direct classroom applications technology can help the teacher communicate with students and parents on a continuous basis and this in turn creates a teacherstudentparent triad partnership that can further academic causes committed teachers can through newsletters announcements virtual tests and assignments calendars discussions and tips extend learning beyond the classroom most of all the introduction of technology into the classroom is a collective learning process often the teacher becomes the learner and this can create better bonds within the classroom learning is fun at all ages and showing students that the teacher is willing and excited to learn can do wonders to the childs attitude towards education the use of technology in the classroom is not without its pitfalls distraction and safety are issues that the teacher must be aware of and know how to handle teachers are responsible for maintaining a safe environment in their classroom and with the introduction of technology safety goes beyond the four walls possible risks include exposure of students to objectionable and inappropriate material cyberbullying and harassment the teacher must be aware of possible security breaches and must be trained in ensuring safety of the students in classroom technologyinduced distraction can be overcome by integrating the internet with instruction careful planning of the days lessons and a certain amount of monitoring it is important for both teacher and student to know that technology is merely a tool to teach the curriculum and cannot replace the curriculum itself there are various types of technology that cater to individuals and groups and synchronous and asynchronous educational activities that can be combined in the classroom as the teacher sees fit development of technology for the classroom must take into account teacher needs and is best when there is input from the teacher during development while the teachers primary goal is indeed to teach the curriculum and not the technology a complete disconnect between technology development and teacher use cannot serve any purpose the use of technology in the classroom can be a liberating experience for both teacher and student in a techenabled classroom the teacher becomes the coordinator or even partner in learning rather than the traditional foster helicopter parent such a shift in teaching style can indeed move the focus from the teacher to the student and expand learning from its traditional confines
environment what does a caged parakeet in connecticut have in common with a scarlet macaw flying freely in costa rica they are both at risk the exotic bird trade remains complex and related statistics are staggering the number of pet birds in the united states is estimated to be between 8 and 40 million and is mostly exotic birds such as parrots and cockatiels with a parrots average lifespan running 75 years these birds will spend agonizing decades in captivity and will likely outlive many of their owners sunday january 5 2014 marks the 13th annual national bird day a day to recognize the threats facing birds both in captivity and in the wild this celebration launched in 2002 by born free usa in coordination with the avian welfare coalition is a reminder of the plight of our winged friends its a day to shine a spotlight on issues critical to the protection and survival of all birds the treatment of parrots one of the most highly soughtafter exotic birds serves as a prime example of these issues the international parrot trade remains a major threat to global parrot populations with roughly onethird of all parrot species in peril additionally the trade causes immense suffering to thousands of individual birds who languish in captivity each day to make matters worse there is an inconsistent patchwork of domestic and international bird laws and regulations in place with poor enforcement to combat bird smuggling in costa rica as in most of latin america the illegal wildlife trade is second only to the narcotics trade in profitability and parrots are one of the most victimized animals their beauty and charisma have become their curse the us government took decisive action more than two decades ago to dramatically curtail the import of wild birds in an effort to reduce the pillaging of nests for these magnificent animals around the world the wild bird conservation act of 1992 effectively shifted the us from being the largest importer of wildcaught birds to one of the smallest aiding in conservation efforts worldwide meanwhile the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora cites continues to provide muchneeded protection to wild bird species globally but the unregulated breeding of exotic bird species in the us continues to flood the market with millions of animals many of these birds are entrusted to humans who are illprepared and illequipped to handle the significant responsibility of their ongoing care overproduction and promotion of parrots and other exotic birds has resulted in an influx of unwanted abused and abandoned birds in shelters and rescue facilities across the us even when bred in captivity exotic birds are not domesticated animals because their natural instincts such as flying flocking and matebonding remain intact basic components of captivity including isolation lack of stimulation and insufficient exercise have led many captive birds to lash out often violently or to continuously talk squawk or sing on average a pet bird remains in a home for only 2 years and is then sold passed on or surrendered of the 100 or so selfidentified bird rescue and rehabilitation facilities in the us a significant portion have been established just in the last few years to address this need and remain overcrowded and underfunded whether birds are wildcaught or captivebred their welfare in captivity is frequently poor it is very difficult to meet the needs of these intelligent highly social flightadapted animals in a home environment the best solution is to replace the demand for birds as pets with a demand to keep all birds in the wild we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support

social a federal judge rejected a plea deal monday afternoon that would have allowed one of the men who killed ahmaud arbery to avoid a federal hate crime trial and said she would deny a deal with another of the men us district judge lisa godbey wood heard arguments monday from arberys family and prosecutors after the department of justice struck plea deals with arberys killers gregory and travis mcmichael over the weekend wood tossed out the plea agreement made with travis mcmichael the man who fatally shot arbery the judge said she would also reject the agreement made with his father gregory mcmichael so his plea hearing was canceled wood gave both mcmichaels an option to move forward with their guilty pleas which could result in a harsher sentence if convicted their decisions on how to plead have to be made by friday according to the judge arberys family was outraged that the plea deals would have allowed the mcmichaels to serve time in federal prison instead of the georgia state system it is not fair to take away the victory i prayed and fought for it is not right it is not fair it is not just wanda cooperjones arberys mother said during the court hearing on monday ahmaud did not get an option of a plea ahmaud was killed ahmaud was hunted down my son was killed i am asking you on behalf of my family please do not accept this deal cooperjones said the mcmichaels who were convicted in november in a georgia state court of murdering arbery reached the plea agreements sunday night in the federal hate crimes case related to the killing the plea agreements came as a surprise to arberys family said family attorney lee merritt the deals according to merritt would have allowed the mcmichaels to serve their first 30 years of the life sentences they received in arberys murder trial in federal prison merritt described it as a softer punishment since federal facilities are safer less crowded and more orderly than georgia prisons the agreements made no mention of william roddie bryan who is also charged with a hate crime in arberys murder all three men were convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison on jan 7 bryan received the possibility of getting parole the doj has gone behind my back to offer the men who murdered my son a deal to make their time in prison easier for them to serve i have made it clear at every possible moment that i do not agree to offer these men a plea deal of any kind cooperjones said before the court proceedings monday i have been completely betrayed by doj lawyers merritt said arberys family has worked hard to make sure the mcmichaels spend the rest of their lives in state custody he called the doj agreements a back room deal and said they represented a betrayal to the arbery family who is devastated about the 25yearolds murder federal prison is a country club when compared to state prison federal prisons are less populated better funded and generally more accommodating than state prisons these men hurriedly entered this plea deal that would allow them to transfer out of custody from ga prison merritt said on twitter late sunday night in essence they get to publicly brag about their hatred then be rewarded by the federal government he added assistant attorney general kristen clarke said the department of justice brought the plea agreement negotiations to the arbery familys attorneys and that they were told the family was not opposed to the agreements we respect the courts decision to not accept the sentencing terms of the proposed plea and to continue the hearing until friday the justice department takes seriously its obligation to confer with the arbery family and their lawyers both pursuant to the crime victim rights act and out of respect for the victim clarke said in a statement before signing the proposed agreement reflecting the defendants confessions to federal hate crimes charges the civil rights division consulted with the victims attorneys the justice department entered the plea agreement only after the victims attorneys informed me that the family was not opposed to it the statement continued the federal hate crimes trial is set to begin on feb 7 jury selection is expected to last up to three weeks the federal hate crime charges accuse the mcmichaels and bryan of violating arberys rights on feb 23 2020 the day they chased and killed him both the mcmichaels were

social where have all the teachers gone its the title of a recent story featured on nprs all things considered highlighting the political and professional challenges that are likely the explanation for declining enrollment in education preparation programs across the country in fact in california enrollment is down 53 percent over the past five years new york and texas are seeing similar declines as well these numbers dont bode well for the education profession as a whole but especially for parents with high hopes for their childs future anxiously awaiting the teacher placement lists posted at the beginning of the school year the savvy ones jockeying for placement in a favorite teachers classroom they know what matters most for the education of their child is not only a safe supportive school but also a great teacher in the classroom they also recognize the importance of a school principal who knows each of her students by name and who is willing to do anything to support the success of their faculty and staff while theres much agreement about how important educators are theres been nothing but controversy spilling over from debates about how to ensure every child has access to excellent educators teachers principals librarians and other staff who help children learn this week senate leaders from both sides of the aisle released their draft proposal to reauthorize the elementary and secondary education act it represents a positive shift away from prescribing evaluation systems that rely too heavily on students standardized test scores as the right medicine for getting rid of bad teachersa trend that has unfortunately been embraced by many states in response to the obama administrations race to the top initiative and nclb waivers the bipartisan compromise shows progress towards a more comprehensive approach to building the capacity of teachers and principals to be successful on the job some of the most promising aspects of the senates most recent nclb rewrite are intended to address the current obstacles deterring people from pursuing careers in education and its no coincidence that key elements of a bill introduced by senators casey of pennsylvania and jack reed of rhode island are included in the bipartisan agreement known as the better educator support and training best act the bill requires states and districts to develop a broad coherent strategy for developing and supporting excellent teachers and school principals it also places a heavy emphasis on clinical training in a real classroom with real students and mentorship for new teachers and principals from accomplished experienced educators it requires regular time for collaboration planning and feedback from peers and administrators and opportunities for professional development tied to the needs of the teacher and the school most importantly it encourages opportunities for growth within the profession so that excellent teachers can become leaders and grow in their careers while still remaining in the classroom unfortunately a critical element of the best act has been omitted from the bipartisan senate draft bill the best act would for the first time write into federal law a standard that every teacher and school principal enter the profession professionready this means that both teachers and principals complete their preparation program demonstrate content knowledge in the subject taught and demonstrate effective teaching and school leadership skills such as through a teacher performance assessment we remain committed to providing you with the

kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again disappointingly the senate proposal fails to establish any minimum entry level standard for educators or provide students with any right to be taught by a professionready teacher we know that lowincome students students of color students with disabilities and english learners are disproportionately taught by underprepared and inexperienced teachersand yet these are the students who most need an excellent educator leading their classrooms its hard to understand how the senate could justify giving billions of federal education dollars to states without requiring in exchange that they provide this most basic educational resource to students a professionready teacher there is still time to establish clear national benchmarks for teachers and principals before they start working in schools the united states has clean water standards auto safety standards drug safety standards and strict rules for airlines safety but no common preparation threshold for educators that has to change immediately along with a genuine commitment from both parties to elevating the teaching profession through new resources and a new lexicon for teaching at the local state and federal level we know it is possible one need look no further than countries like finland or just over the border in ontario canada educational experts from across the spectrum have articulated this vision for the united states including the coalition for teaching quality an entity representing over 100 civil rights disability parent student educator and education policy organizations who have been urging both political parties and the obama administration to take a longterm approach to teaching quality some members of congress are listening including senators casey and reed it seems like chairman lamar alexander and ranking member patty murray are starting to listen as well but they cant take up the where have all the teachers gone policy question alone and their proposal needs some fine tuning still we need more policymakers and parents pushing for a day when there isnt a rush to see the school lists of who will be teaching their child because every classroom is led by an excellent teacher as congress continues to move on reauthorization of esea lets encourage policymakers from both sides of the aisle to invest in a teaching force that has the preparation support and expertise to lead not leave coauthored by tara kini a consulting attorney with public

assault issue the details of sophias attack are documented in the lawsuit where she is identified as jane doe 3 the case was filed in 2017 and updated in march when sophia and six other women joined the suit while a few of the other women suing have shared their stories publicly sophia is only now coming forward to huffpost to share her experiences the women want uber to fix what they see as its flawed background check system the lawsuit says because the system is designed to quickly approve drivers uber skips steps that would screen out sex offenders like the one who assaulted sophia according to the suit though uber has recently announced changes to its system these women say theyre insufficient the women say the only way they can force uber to improve its standards is if they bring their case into a public courtroom and this highlights a second possibly even larger issue with uber when users download the app they unwittingly click away their right to file a lawsuit against the company uber has already filed a motion in court arguing that these women have no right to make their case in a public courtroom that spurred action from the nine women and a few others who penned an open letter to the companys board of directors urging uber to reconsider secret arbitration takes away a womans right to a trial by a jury of her peers and provides a dark alley for uber to hide from the justice system the media and public scrutiny the women wrote uber defended its use of arbitration in a statement in march when the case expanded but has since changed its tune somewhat during a twitter exchange with susan fowler a former uber employee who famously shared her story of workplace sexual harassment and discrimination uber ceo dara khosrowshahi said he would look at the issue sexual assault has no place anywhere and we are committed to doing our part to help end this violence the company told huffpost in a statement as we prioritize safety at uber we are taking a hard look at these important issues in arbitration each woman would have to fight her case alone on an individual level the best outcome would be maybe a cash settlement often such settlements are kept private through nondisclosure agreements so other assault victims wouldnt learn about women whove gone through similar experiences the chances that the company would be forced to reexamine the way it does business are nil sophia told huffpost shes not doing this for money but to effect change the only thing i can really do is help others she said i think its stronger to join others so we can help others not have this happen to them publicly embarrassed by the letter with khosrowshahi getting called out on twitter the company asked for more time from the court to consider the womens plea uber now has a courtsanctioned deadline of may 17 to formally decide if its sexual assault issues get a public airing out at a time when women are increasingly unwilling to stay silent about sexual abuse the idea that a company can keep its problems private through arbitration has become harder to defend there are bills at both the federal and state level to stop companies from forcing women into arbitration in sexual harassment and assault cases microsoft announced earlier this year that it would no longer force harassment cases filed by its employees into arbitration orrick a major law firm made a similar announcement in march at a time when women are increasingly unwilling to stay silent about sexual abuse the idea that a company can keep its problems private through arbitration has become harder to defend uber has said it has no issue with these women telling their stories in public but news stories alone cant always bring justice or closure to victims theres a particular power in letting rape survivors bring their stories into a public courtroom and to have other women join them and say me too anyone who watched the victims of larry nassar confront their disgraced abuser in a michigan courtroom in january knows this we saw the power of a public trial again in the bill cosby case having public disclosure in a courtroom about what happened thats part of the public record theres a real power in that said hannah brenner a professor at california western school of law who researches the intersection of law and gender focusing specifically on sexual assault institutions and disparate power dynamics that these women have banded together is particularly powerful theres a tendency for us to dismiss sexual violence as a oneoff brenner said collectively these women are a force more difficult to ignore citing hundreds of media reports about uberrelated sexual assault the women suing the company say it has a systemic problem on its hands jeanne christensen the lawyer representing the nine women has been representing rape and assault victims in cases against uber since at least 2014 shes negotiated privately with uber case by case but said that last year she grew fed up with the oneoff system and became determined to push the company to do more the stories are always the same she told huffpost christensens clients typically said they hailed an uber ride after a night of drinking and that their driver then assaulted and in some cases raped them she couldnt go into more detail citing confidentiality many of her clients are living in fear she said afraid their attacker will come after them again its very common for clients to move apartments they break leases thats how frightened they are she said they get new phones change their numbers yet its hard to know the real scope of ubers sexual assault problems the company does not release information about reported incidents police departments dont track rape data that way and sadly most women do not report sexual assault to anyone at all the company said it is looking at ways to better track assaults while rapes and assaults that take place in uber cars do get a lot of media attention they are just a small percentage of sexual assaults in the us strangers arent the biggest danger when it comes to rape while the uber assaults are scary women are still most at risk of being assaulted by someone they know said melissa morabito a professor at the school of criminology and justice studies center for women work at the university of massachusetts lowell earlier this spring uber announced a host of changes meant to strengthen its background check process for drivers as well as several new safety features and khosrowshahi has said publicly that safety is his no 1 priority the uber app will now be better integrated with 911 making it easier for emergency services to find you on the road the company said it would rerun background checks on all drivers each year to make sure no new incidents have cropped up something it did inconsistently in the past uber also said it would begin using a technology that would alert them when uber drivers were arrested in real time the company offers features that ensure every trip is gps tracked 247 response from our safety team and the ability to share your trip with loved ones in real time and were committed to doing more it said in a statement uber also announced it was bringing on former us secretary of homeland security jeh johnson as chairman of ubers safety advisory board but christensen says these moves are not enough ubers checking process isnt much different than the credit check youd have to go through if you were trying to rent an apartment she told huffpost the check only goes back seven years according to the womens lawsuit uber says that its checks can extend beyond that period depending on the database the company is searching the company needs to run drivers fingerprints through the fbi and department of justices databases the suit says uber says that the fingerprint system is not a panacea and comes with its own set of flaws there are concerns for example that some people who havent been convicted or whove had their charges dismissed get inaccurately labeled as criminals the company cites data that show hundreds of thousands of americans cant get jobs because of flaws and inaccuracies in the system uber argues that while no background check is perfect our process is robust fair and relevant to the work at hand the predominance of regulators believe that our screening processes are appropriate khosrowshahi told the washington post recently i dont think fingerprints would substantially change what happens with human behavior the predators in life look for dark corners our job is to tell the world that uber has its lights on sexual assault is about a predator stealing a part of you that you will never get back i fight unceasingly against the shame the loss of feeling safe and the debilitating anxiety sophia wrote in a statement she shared with huffpost read it in full below if uber had done their due diligence my devastation could have been avoided for now sophia is trying to find another place to live she will only stay the night at home if her roommates are around she said she fears that the uber driver who assaulted her might come look for her again sophia fought her attacker off that december night in a struggle that lasted minutes but that she said felt infinite i dont know if youve ever been in a car accident where time is moving extremely slow youre trying to make the best decisions you possibly can but if youre in the state too long your brain cant handle it sophia told huffpost youre in a constant state of panic its like going in and out of consciousness she said she punched the uber driver in the stomach and ran into her apartment locking the door and windows the morning after the attack she opened her uber app and reported the incident i think i was still in shock i didnt think about the right way to do this sophia said she figured since she had a problem with the service she should start there it seemed like the right move very quickly i realized it was not the right move sexual assault is about a predator stealing a part of you that you will never get back a customer service rep called sophia back and she told the woman what happened she said shed reimburse me for the ride and that they take this seriously and shed follow up again soon it was a very short call sophia said estimating that the conversation probably took less than five minutes the representative wasnt particularly empathetic sophia compared her demeanor to that of a barista taking your coffee order my 17 back was just not what i was going for it didnt make me feel safer that was the main thing she said i didnt feel any safer and it was a pointless call sophia walked to her local police department after that the cops talked to her for hours she said uber eventually got back to her and told her that her driver was no longer working for the company and that hed been warned by the police not to come near her i dont know what happened to him she said the company didnt respond to specific questions about sophias allegations sophia doesnt use the uber app anymore but said that living in san francisco its impossible not to be reminded of the service every day every time i have a noxious reaction she said adding that she now feels like she had blinders on when it came to using the app she figured uber was a strong business and had naturally figured this safety thing out she said i got a little bit fooled by that i didnt think enough through about what they were doing i dont think they did either sexual assault is about a predator stealing a part of you that you will never get back there is no settlement amount or number of criminal convictions that can replace what has forever been lost to me this is the most painful aspect of being a sexual assault survivor ive been given a lifesentence of battling the excruciating psychological effects of being violated i fight unceasingly against the shame the loss of feeling safe and the debilitating anxiety while i am strong and resilient while i do not want to victimize myself i want to be transparent and honest about the reality of surviving trauma as i do not know how else to protect others if uber had done their due diligence my devastation could have been avoided they hired a man whose personal information and picture are the exact match of a registered sex offender the same man i accurately identified in a photolineup this is the uber driver who drove me home after a work event followed me into my apartment building and assaulted me uber is neglecting to acknowledge the severity and frequency of the sexual assault crimes being committed by asking for arbitration by the same token uber is missing my purpose and that of many other women in joining this classaction this is not for me this is for every person reading this for anyone who wants to strive for a world that does not turn a blind eye to acts of sexual violence its too late for me i am striving for it to not be too late for you as for uber id appreciate it if you stopped saying that you take these allegations very seriously while the intention may be genuine the lack of action proves otherwise according to ubers website there are approximately 15 million uber rides daily and 75 million monthly users for each day that you continue to put an incredible number of passengers at risk for each day that you seek profit over safety for each day that you try to silence womeni will not be able to conceive how that statement could possibly be true this story has been updated to include more information from uber on how far back its driver background checks extend need help visit rainns national sexual assault online hotline or the national sexual violence resource centers website

health the morning my life changed forever was like many other mornings i went on an early morning jog in central park with my german shepherd it was a pleasant spring day midway through our run we came upon a little crowd grouped in a semicircle about three meters from the trunk of an oak tree i soon saw what attracted them a squirrel sat perfectly still immobilized at the base of the tree a pointer dog three feet from the squirrel intense and poised focused his entire energy at the tiny gray creature i joined the crowd enveloped in the drama of course no one knew what would happen next but unlike the suspense involved in a sports event no one rooted for either side in spite of the tension around me a sense of calmness overcame me as if time had stopped and all of life was contained here in this moment i had an insight the world doesnt revolve around you jane you are a very very small part of the world that immerses you suddenly the pointer leaped toward the tree and the squirrel dashed up the trunk the moment broke the crowd collectively sighed then dispersed and scattered but i had changed now envisioning myself like a newly hatched chick perceiving the light for the first time i sensed my place as a tiny being born to imbibe and attempt to understand the world in contrast to experiencing myself at the center of it i hadnt experienced the here and now with this degree of intensity before since i knew that a goal of buddhism is to be fully present in the moment i shared this incident with a buddhist colleague she defined my experience as satori a japanese buddhist term for awakening or seeing into ones true nature also referred to as enlightenment as a psychiatrist acquainted with the definition of narcissism i realized that i hadnt been aware of the extent of my own narcissism that is experiencing the world as revolving around me now liberated from this grandiose self that had placed a selfconscious me at the center i viewed myself and the world in a new and wonderful perspective the narcissistic self constantly measures and asks am i ok am i superior or inferior the sense of self fluctuates between an ideal self which fails to live up to impossible standards and then seeps into the stance of despised self wallowing in selfhatred breaking free of this construct allowed me to process circumstances in the moment free to become engrossed in life later i realized this narcissistic self lies at the root of many creative andor writers blocks i think of the child prodigy the great canadian musician glenn gould who in spite of enormous achievements suffered from selfcriticism that most likely curtailed his performing career free of narcissism we can be grounded in the real the socalled here and now recognizing our place as an experiment of nature each of us oneofakind when we aspire to be the best of our unique nature no one including ourselves can ask more of us discarding the confining equation of the two selves is equivalent to soaring unfettered into the stratosphere no self or beyond self is the truly free self able to experience boundless gratitude this blog post is part of a series for huffpost gratitude entitled the moment gratitude changed my perspective to see all the other posts in the series click here

technology human traffickers worldwide use technology to recruit exploit and monitor their victims they lure victims in internet chats and forums post online recruitment and classified advertisements and use sophisticated anonymity software to cloak their identities victims are men women children transgender and nonconforming individuals who are trafficked for sex and forced labor they are foreign nationals and united states citizensresidents there are numerous human trafficking definitions but the palermo protocol is the worldwide standard the protocolalso known as the united nations protocol to prevent suppress and punish trafficking in persons especially women and childrensupplements the 2000 united nations convention against transnational organized crime and has been ratified by 167 nations including the united states it contains three elements the act of trafficking the means of trafficking and the purpose of trafficking the act of trafficking is the recruitment transportation transfer harboring or receipt of persons the means of trafficking is the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion abduction fraud deception abuse of power or vulnerability or giving payments or benefits to a person in control of the victim the purpose of trafficking is exploitation this includes at a minimum sexual exploitation including the exploitation of the prostitution of others forced labor or services slavery or practices similar to slavery servitude or the removal of organs exact numbers are challenging but a quick glance at the international organization for migration iom which has the largest victim assistance caseload assisted nearly 7000 human trafficking victims in 115 nations during 2015 the vast majority of victims74 percentwere trafficked for forced labor or services and more than half553 percentwere male as internet use becomes increasingly commonplace worldwide so too does its use for recruitment in poland the antitrafficking nongovernmental organization ngo la strada found that even nearly a decade ago 90 percent of poles who found jobs abroad did so through the internet the ngo estimated that 30 percent of trafficking victims it served were recruited this way1 technology isnt just used in monitoring and recruitment but also to sell the sexual services of trafficking victims this is primarily done through online classified websites the site most used for doing soat least since craigslist closed its adult services section in 2010is the classified ad website backpagecom yiota g souras senior vice president and general counsel at the national center for missing exploited children testified before the united states senate permanent subcommittee on investigations that more than 71 percent of suspected child trafficking reports submitted by the public to the cybertipline involve backpagecom this does not include reports backpagecom makes to the cybertipline in march the us senate unanimously voted to hold backpagecom in civil contempt of congress the site says the senate did not comply with a subpoena that required backpagecom to provide among other evidence documents on its procedures for moderating and reviewing advertisements metadata and document retention the permanent subcommittee on investigations reported it found evidence that the site sometimes edits classified ad content before publication such as deleting words and images this likely served said the committee to remove evidence of the illegality of the underlying transaction in october authorities raided backpagecoms dallas headquarters and arrested its ceo carl ferrer under pimping a minor and conspiracy charges in order to combat the use of classified advertisements online recruitmentjob postings forums and chats that facilitate modern slavery the defense advanced research projects agency darpa an agency of the us department of defense has developed a sophisticated search engine called dig domainspecific insight graphs memex unlike google or bing dig memex plunges into deep web depths web areas not indexed by conventional search engines it can search all online sex ads there are more than 60 million instantaneously extracting and linking hidden information on online illicit activity and disclose trafficking network names and numbers in order to accomplish this dig memex searches various networks including tor software that gives users web anonymity through onion routing and was created by the naval research laboratory interestingly darpa actually contributes financially to tor and several tor project developers are working on dig memex the search engine also digs through freenet which allows users to anonymously share files chat on forums and use in darknet mode and i2p which creates an anonymous network within a network manhattan is one of the first cities to deploy dig memex which already has a database packed with tens of millions web pages and grows by 5000 pages per hour the curated counter trafficking domain index includes sex trafficking and forced labor but initially focused on the former in fact this seems to be an issue across the board when it comes to combating human trafficking it appears the technology world hasnt yet figured out how to best hone in on labor indicators the small business ist research which works on memex is trying to figure it out using its pulse information sharing and analysis platform ist research is monitoring the supply chain collating passive internet data on the deep web to find unscrupulous recruitment networks and determining the best communication method to reach victims and produce active engagement the concept of using technology to combat criminal activity has existed well as long as the proliferation of technology the telephone twoway radio and automobile changed the law enforcement landscape in the twentieth century today the internet text messaging voicemail social media networking and email are continuing to change the law enforcement and advocacy topography the challenge of course is that with ample funds and ready access to new technologies traffickers are often steps ahead in 2012 president obama implored all techies to join the

companies and advocates and law enforcementand were also challenging college studentsto develop tools that our young people can use to stay safe online and on their smart phones many private technology companies are already on boardapplying their expertise and funds to disrupt and combat human trafficking for example in 2011 google gave 115 million in grants to support antitrafficking technology initiatives including those driven by ngos and nonprofit organizations such as international justice mission slavery footprint and polaris project the latter organization has partnered with silicon valley companies palantir salesforce twilio and thorn digital defenders of childrenfounded by demi moore and ashton kutcher in order to disrupt traffickers and identify victims polaris launched the nhtrc crisis and tip reporting hotline in 2007 with specialists that can answer calls in more than 200 languages the 24 hours a day 7 days a week hotline received and receives roughly 100 calls a day from a variety of callers such as victims and survivors concerned friends and family members worried neighbors and organizations wanting to know how best to serve their human trafficking survivor population since its inception the multimodal hotline has received 107982 phone calls 6550 web form contacts and 7667 emails that resulted in the identification of 25791 human trafficking cases partnerships between silicon valley and polaris have resulted in a multitude of strides in the antitrafficking effort thanks to these relationships nhtrc hosts befree a textline where victims can simply text befree 233733 in order to reach a specialist this is critical because it may be less risky for a victim depending on hisher particular trafficking situation to send a text message than make a phone call the result has been a significant uptick in victims contacting the nhtrc befree launched on march 28 2013 and so far has had roughly 3617 text conversations that led to 424 human trafficking cases a larger percentage of victims reach out to nhtrc through text than by phone call 23 percent compared to 11 percent respectively the nhtrc also has an easytouse dashboard at their fingertips that lets them quickly locate the most proximate resources for victims access 150 data variables and triage information to law enforcement all data is collected through the sophisticated silicon valley salesforce software system freedom force which syncs nightly with palantir data analysis software that examines aggregated data and uncovers human trafficking trends the analysis platform maps trafficking cases trafficking networks and can even identify a travel route traffickers are using not only does this allow nhtrc to immediately connect victims to resources it also gives polaris critical insights to pass along to law enforcement and policymakers helping to address the issue on multiple levels techdriven antitrafficking groups are constantly amending their approach to include the newest influx of popular technology historically traffickers have been dozens of steps ahead if not more the partnerships between silicon valley and ngos have thankfully begun narrowing

research consortium building residents driving past nobic wonder what goes on there the facility moves lifescience research particularly from local universities into commercial channels by supporting startups and existing firms engaged in health and medical services diagnostics therapeutics and environmental applications nobic has 29 tenants including ten using wetlab space and it has another ten clients outside its tenant list we serve forty companies in various stages of development and theyre local and from around the country nobic president aaron miscenich said at a louisiana chapter of the association for corporate growth lunch in new orleans on dec 4 miscenich is also executive director of the louisiana cancer research consortium nobics collaborative setting includes 66000 square feet of office wetlab and conference space weve learned theres a real need for office space now miscenich said the lab area however is only 30 to 40 percent occupied dr yaye sarr shares office space at nobic with other startups as she prepares to launch smiles2geaux in january s2g formed as a nonprofit a year ago is a mobile dental clinic for senior citizens and children to the age of 21 the city

consultant has also aided s2g a native of senegal sarr worked in african dental programs before she earned a phd in public health at tulane in new orleans she noticed some of the same accesstocare issues here that she saw back home at some point i may use lab space at the bioinnovation center for benches to do work on dentures and other dental devices sarr said students from tulanes public heath school will help staff her program mobile clinics will visit assistedliving facilities senior centers and schools for more than a year nanofex llc which makes powders for cleaning contaminated soil and ground water has rented space in nobic nanofex ceo david culpepper said last week were using nanotechnology derived from louisiana crawfish and crab shells and sugar cane based on research at tulane by chemical and biomolecular engineering professor vijay john were building a south louisianabased venture and hope to market our product within a year we intend to hire local people nanofex has benefited from nobics expertise they have tons of interns and others with advanced degrees he said the staff helped him assemble a recent powerpoint presentation they have free monthly seminars like the one im attending today on accounting for startups he said nanofex has applied for a national science foundation grant to rent nobic lab space which is reasonably priced culpepper said at xavier university of louisiana gene damour senior vice president for resource development explained the need for nobic xavier receives 10 million a year in life science funds from the national institutes of health the national science foundation the dept of defense and a variety of foundations he said our science faculty members do fairly basic research like designing new drugs and new drugdelivery systems when they come up with new discoveries they need to test them on animals and carry out clinical trials on human populations to make sure the drugs arent toxic and that they have the predicted effects this process becomes very expensive as their costs rise researchers turn to the nih for small business investment research and small business technology transfer grants which provide funding from one to five years he said the bioinnovation center is uniquely and extraordinary helpful in working with faculty to form and incorporate new researchbased businesses damour said xavier chemistry professor guangdi wang is working with nobic to develop a business based on a new drug that prevents side effects from breastcancer medication damour said in addition to access to lawyers and accountants to get a startup moving so it can deliver a new product nobic helps startups attract venture capital and assists them with marketing without the centers help it would be difficult to get scientific research from local universities into commercial channels damour is a board member of the bioinnovation center and is also chairman of the biodistrict of new orleans board xaviers pharmacy college is one of two in the state with the other at the university of louisiana in monroe the universitys pharmacy program received 125 million from the qatar katrina fund to build a pharmacy building addition in 2009 in september nobic launched a 17 million new orleans biofund providing lowinterest financing to life science startups miscenich said the fund fills a need since credit for small businesses has been tight money from the us dept of housing and urban development and the states office of community developmentdisaster recovery unit seeded the biofund which is managed by nobics kris khalil loans can be as large as 250000 meanwhile nobics startups have created more than 47 fulltime and 36 parttime jobs so far the centers tenants have raised 14 million in financing and 2 million in grants miscenich said louisiana has three lifescience hubs new orleans baton rouge and monroe nobics challenge will be to keep the companies it incubates within the local economy he said some of the directors of nobicassisted startups are from other states and they could move firms theyve established here other states offer credits and grants for bio startups we need to make sure the jobs created stay here miscenich said over a decade ago local leaders and louisiana state university hatched plans to make midcity new orleans a bio center economists cited a need to diversify beyond tourism shipping and public administration but residents have questioned the destruction of lower midcity homes to make way for the biodistrict and strains on the states healthcare budget could impact the number of beds at the new lsu medical center damour said in the next couple of months the new orleans city council might vote on a 15 construction impact fee on new building in the biodistrict the fee would help pay for the districts operations and infrastructure end we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you

worldnews i guess its a sign of desperation interest in israel among young jews is way down and among the community at large only 23 percent of jewish voters list israel as among their top three considerations when deciding for whom to vote a mere 6 percent say israel is the no 1 factor in casting their votes the election of donald trump only accelerated the decline in interest in israel jews overwhelmingly opposed trump in the november 2016 election that opposition has only intensified as antisemitism has seriously spiked since his inauguration its lost on no one that the chant of the racist demonstrators at the violent altright riot in charlottesville was the jews will not replace us all in all these are scary times for jews right here at home as for israel american jewish discomfort with the occupation and netanyahus policies in general combined with fears about developments in our own country have moved it far from the center of jewish concerns simply put we have more immediate threats to worry about accordingly it appears that its time for the israel lobby led by aipac but consisting of all the jewish mainstream organizations to scare jews into worrying about antisemitism but not the antisemitism of the altright and the more extreme trump supporters but the supposed antisemitism of critics of israel they know that progressive critics of israels behavior are safer targets than the real antisemites of the right who are dangerously close to the trump administration in a previous piece on huffpost i wrote about the bipartisan congressional effort to criminalize those who choose to boycott israel to protest the occupation in fact fighting the boycott effort led by the bds boycott divestment and sanctions movement is aipacs highest priority right after securing israels multibillion dollar aid package which actually passes with no opposition anyway in any case a new front has been opened in the battle to use fear of antisemitism to scare jews into supporting israel and it is absolutely astounding earlier this week the house judiciary committee held a hearing on the antisemitism awareness act which would if violated withhold federal financial assistance to colleges and universities which tolerate criticism of israel the bill which has already passed the senate offers no new protections to jews per se who are protected under existing civil rights laws or putting it simply criticizing israel after all criticism of israel is routinely labelled as delegitimization demonization and holding israel to a double standard by israels rightwing supporters on pretty much every campus in the united states already if this bill passed progressive organizations palestinian student groups or antioccupation jewish organizations like j street or if not now could be shut down on the grounds that their presence put the university in danger of losing federal funding this is crazy stuff nonetheless the house judiciary committee held its hearing on it this week at which major jewish organizations testified in its support j street issued a statement in strong opposition and again the bill has already passed the senate my guess is that it will pass the house too after all the lobby rarely loses its carefully chosen battles and then the fight will begin some professor will say that in his opinion the state of israels creation was a mistake or a student group students for palestine or j street will set up an exhibit portraying the occupation of hebron or the blockade of gaza or a progressive organization will call for the evolution of israel into a single state with equal rights for all its people one of the proisrael organizations will file suit and suddenly a university will be fighting to maintain the federal funding it needs for research or scholarships or it can just shut down the troublemakers its not hard to imagine which course they will choose we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again

social the full range of debate about the big standardized tests really comes down to answering two critical questions about the testing the whole justification for the bs tests is that they will collect all sorts of rich and useful data about students schools and educational programs i have been amazed at the widespread childlike bland faith that many people have in anything called a standardized test if its a standardized test then surely it must measure real stuff with accuracy reliability and validity sure the reasoning goes they wouldnt be putting the test out there if it werent really measuring stuff but to date no evidence has appeared that the bs tests are reliable valid or actually measuring anything that they claim to measure the test contents are locked under a giant cone of secrecy as if the test is some sort of educational vampire that will evaporate if sunlight hits it nor have the data collected by the bs test been clearly linked to anything useful well since she got a great score on the parcc we can be assured that she will be a happy productive and rich member of society said nobody ever nor is the data rich with any level of data at all instead we get reports that are the equivalent of saying the student was either pathetic sad okee dokeeish and mighty swell do the bs tests measure anything other than the students ability to take the bs tests do the test results actually mean anything if the test fans cant answer those questions were wasting everyones time the tests are supposed to provide data on which to act does that can that happen on the classroom level no data is too meager nontransparent and just plain late to do anybody any good well last year you score okeedokeeish because you missed some questions that im not allowed to see so ive customized an educational program to address what i imagine your problem areas used to be is not a useful thing to say to a student but what about identifying schools that need help is the data used to help those schools not unless by help you mean close or take over or strip of resources so students can go to a charter instead our current system does not identify schools for help it identifies schools for punishment of course its hard to come up with a good action plan based on bad data which is why we need answers to question 1 before we can do anything with question 2 well maybe but it doesnt matter because right now our process is as follows 1 hey your bicycle looks like its not working right 2 ive measured the lead content of the paint on the bicycle by squeezing the bouncy part of the seat your bike is definitely defective we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again 3 i have thrown your bicycle in the dumpster we arent measuring anything and we arent fixing anything outside of that testdriven accountability is working out very okee dokeeish this post originally appeared at curmudgucation
social in late january of last year the us department of justice announced that it would be seeking the death penalty in the case against boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev many were outraged carol rose a lawyer journalist and executive director of the aclu of massachusetts wrote a stirring piece titled vengeance is not justice where she eloquently expresses that we should not let anyone shake us from our commitment to due process fair trials and respect for human life attorney general eric holder recently called for a national moratorium on the death penalty until the supreme court has the opportunity to weigh in on this matter while i like you would never hurt or wish harm upon anyone i am having a hard time finding forgiveness for pathetic lives like tsarnaev or maybe i have felt a moment of sadness as to what went wrong with a seemingly regular kid but its only that a moment of sadness i certainly have no lasting mercy for him how can i after analyzing the inhumanity of this premeditated coldblooded murder and mayhem rightfully oppose the worst possible punishment for this ingrate the thought process that went into planning this horrendous blood bath was ingenious target those that are physically almost superhuman and kill them or better still incapacitate them by blowing up their limbs go after the innocent bystanders at a dogood event and wreak havoc sickening if someone came after my family and dearest friends with serious harm on their mind i know i would do anything to save my loved ones most likely even the unthinkable can the opponents of the death penalty even though they find it reprehensible emphatically claim that they would never take anyones life even if it were for selfdefense or the defense of their loved ones rose writes in a very real sense this trial is about us the people of massachusetts and whether we will sacrifice our values and our commitment to justice in the face of terror this trial to me is about each person who was violated that day and for every other person who has to live for the rest of their lives with the guilt and helplessness of not being able to protect their loved ones i am no saint i am sick and tired of people pretending to be martyrs and standing up for the rights of the sinner recently there was a similar outrage over the jan 16 execution of dennis mcguire the defense attorney and other sympathizers decried his execution by lethal injection apparently gone wrong for a few minutes as inhumane and agonizing i too felt a pang of sadness until i found out that this butcher was responsible for the inhumane and agonizing kidnapping rape and killing of a 22yearold newly married almost 8 months pregnant woman in 1989 mcguire confessed that he raped joy stewart viciously and stabbed her twice in the neck and that the first time it hit a bone so he pulled the knife back out and stuck her again do i feel sorry for dennis mcguire yes i do but only because he breathed and lived for 25 years after this nauseating act whereas joy and her unborn baby did not live to see another day because of this heartless monster look i understand that the death penalty should never be taken lightly i also understand that it is certainly not a deterrent but that is not the purpose of the death penalty the death penalty is simply to rid the earth of scumbags like tsarnaev and mcguire who have gone out of their way to mutilate another a feb 2 los angeles times editorial declared cases like this the boston marathon bombing test our strength as a mature democracy and as a people who believe in justice thats not to say convicted murderers and other perpetrators of egregious crimes shouldnt face severe punishment life without parole is the correct response in these extreme cases it punishes the criminal while protecting society from future acts of violence as a nation that believes in justice we should drop our embrace of the death penalty as a relic of the barbaric past but if life without parole is the ultimate punishment why is it that almost every single death row inmate has repeatedly filed for a stay of execution opting desperately for life behind bars instead of death thats because life is precious and even the most deplorable human being gets it when it comes to preserving his own david r dow a distinguished professor at the university of houston law center and an acclaimed death row lawyer in an interview with the nation had this to say about his clients let me be clear most of my clients want to live most of them prefer a life of virtually no freedom to no life at all underlying this preference is a hope however faint they might one day get out sadly there is not the slightest glimmer of hope for the victims and their loved ones i do not seek vengeance ordinarily but when extraordinary things are sometimes done to innocent people vengeance unfortunately is as close as it gets to justice what is truly more barbaric deliberately raping and chopping a mother to be staging a vicious attack to blow up life and limb in the name of unholy jihad or ensuring that the innocent victims get a fair shot at justice when you strip away the fancy legal jargon the drama of defending the monsters and the glamorization of the dignity of life toward all the picture is grimly simple an innocent victims who did not stand a chance against a malicious perpetrator with the sole purpose of causing the ultimate harm i am sorry but i see no choice other than to side with those who were handed the death penalty by a savage animal i strongly support the right to life of the victim vengeance is sometimes fair
technology last month audiovisual content rights holders announced the new copyright alert system aka six strikes that they and isps have put in place to discourage peertopeer file sharing of copyrighted files good luck its 2013 guys time to join the new century six strikes is going to be ineffective and is bad for business dont get me wrong i dont believe that content wants to be free but i do believe that content wants to be freely available so the issue should really be about making content accessible not about piracy in fairness to the media dinosaurs the message is starting to seep through nbcuniversals rick cotton their chief counsel and head of their antipiracy unit admitted somewhat grudgingly towards the end of a wsj interview that content availability was a priority and yet the ip hawks continue to flog this inane piracy obsession 1 hackers always trump blockers with antipiracy efforts thoroughly unsuccessful up to now why are rights holders throwing more resources at this issue the six strikes plan is quite involved and can only be understood by paying close attention to the video and text explanations provided on the industrys center for copyright information website im sure that every responsible content consumer will hastily beat a path to this website to become informed in other words no one is going to care about this until of course they get notified that theyre infringing the industry has clearly spent a bundle on thinking this thing through signing one another up to the plan and launching it out into the consumersphere but at the end of the day it has no teeth as the electronic frontier foundation explains on its faq no two isps have the same strategy for alerting and penalizing infringers some will throttle back your bandwidth some will require that you take a copyright education class but no one is going to shut off your account and forgo your subscription dollars duh 2 consumption drives more consumption why does the industry continue to believe that penalizing customers is a good thing getting connected is expensive bandwidth costs seem to be edging up while bit rates are woefully slow in the us in comparison to europe and asia are you or any of your friends thrilled with your isp and all the great services it provides to make sure you have a great online experience how about your cable provider i didnt think so so on top of all this your isp is going to turn you into a criminal for wanting to access content that is for the most part not available legally but should be 3 limiting access to content forces consumers to pirate ive quoted the studies before why are rights holders continuing to focus on copyright infringementpiracy instead of making more content available for people to pay for legally on the center for copyright information website there is a linked graphic called how do i find the movies and music i want legally click on it and it takes you to a page of cable and isp logos that link to the industry partners what a joke its an endless loop the fact is that consumers who want to play by the rules are being treated like dirt content providers are not keeping up with demand and at the same time decrying how their revenues are shrinking in the face of the collapse of the dvd business and the supposed tide of piracy the key to 21st century monetization of content is scale instead of trying to preserve old windowed distribution models based on limiting access to content in order to maintain artificial price points providers need to understand that they can no longer control pricing because they can no longer control access so if access is everywhere and demand is everywhere why not take a smaller piece of a zillion transactions vs insisting on 400 for a vod title or 12 for a dvd or whatever and then cower in fear at the decreasing demand for what is to the consumer overpriced content content is just content its a commodity its popcorn this weeks new movie opening at the theater has the same value to the consumer as last months movie or last years tv series or the 2010 superbowl so lets not try to protect it by prioritizing ways of limiting access or penalizing

economy its been a fitful few months for the dakota access pipeline first a federal judge ruled that the army corps of engineers failed to carry out proper environmental reviews of the project before building the oil route under a vital waterway then the same judge ordered the pipeline to shut down while the monthslong reviews take place last month the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit staved off the latter order on wednesday the appeals court handed the pipeline and its texasbased owner energy transfer another win ruling that the trump administration should decide whether its safe to continue operating while the project undergoes review but the decision isnt a clearcut victory for the controversial pipeline which galvanized a national protest movement in 2016 the army corps of engineers which is expected to greenlight the pipeline to keep pumping oil must submit its reasoning for continued operation to the lower court that originally ordered the shutdown this is something that kicks the can down the road three months maybe four months or however long the army corps can drag this out brandon barnes a senior energy litigation analyst at the research firm bloomberg intelligence said by phone the army corps isnt expected to complete its review of the pipeline until the middle of next year if democratic presidential candidate joe biden defeats president donald trump in november the new administration could dramatically reverse the pipelines fortunes particularly if democrats retake control of the senate once in office biden could slow the review process by probing the trump administrations decisions on the pipeline he could also direct the army corps of engineers to abandon the oil route the obama administration in which biden served as vice president blocked construction of the dakota access pipeline in december 2016 after months of protests at which heavily militarized security forces attacked peaceful demonstrators energy transfers stock climbed nearly 5 on wednesday afternoon following the ruling but the price remains well below the nearly 26pershare it hit before the first environmental review order was handed down in march the attorneys litigating the pipelines case however are almost certainly faring well the court battle is strangely neverending barnes said its a virtuous circle for the lawyers
social no matter what its called its here and it will change the way teachers teach and students learn some years ago a little nonprofit called roadtrip nation partnered with high schools across the country to ask them who they might like to interview on film which the students were taught how to use to help them better understand their own curiosity about the real world and learn what was possible as the three founders all recent grads of the same college put it weve talked to everyone from supreme court justices to lobstermen and used their insights to shape every career resource we make the goal to give you the tools to live a life doing what matters to you now in middle schools and high schools across america teachers are learning how to give their students the real world experience solve real world problems collaborate with real experts in the field and fellow students and have fun its called authentic learning placebased learning projectbased learning pbl experiential learning but the goal and the technique is the same according to the twenty five year old education research organization the buck institute it is a teaching method in which students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an authentic engaging and complex question problem or challenge it all starts with a problema real problem like saving ocean species global warming or the dangers of using plastic bags as students get into exploring the depth of the problem and identifying possible solutions they research the problem interview experts and present results in concise highly readable and visual forms demonstrating their abilities to communicate they are engaged learning skills gaining the knowledge and expertise the workforce is looking for it totally changes how they learn and the teachers teach as ben johnson a career educator put it for the educational website edutopia great teachers do not teach they stack the deck so that students have a reason to learn and in the process cant help but learn mainly by teaching themselves this knowledge then becomes permanent and cherished rather than illusory and irrelevant in san diego e3 civic high also known as the school in a library prepares students for college career and lifelong learning through projectbased instruction cutting edge technology expansive research facilities via our exclusive location within the san diego public library and active civic engagement in the downtown community at high tech high also in san diego they do not teach all the disciplines per se ie math science art and music etc but rather through real world projects or challenges requiring collaboration out of the box thinking research observation and multiple communication skills assigned at the beginning of each semester and team taught by the teachers further upstate in hawthorne california the da vinci schools separated into four schools only for emphasis by science design communication and innovation all use project based learning methods they also use community partners consisting of many of the experts teachers will need play a vital role by helping to align their projects to industry expertise and standards recognizing that this new teaching methodology is difficult for many teachers whose personal knowledge and experience may not provide them the knowhow to frame the questions broadly or the possible solutions or even to understand what pbl is the national education association nea provides a handbook introducing the subset web resources and list of examples and best practices the nea tells us the concept may have been around since the early 1900s and that john dewey supported the learning by doing approach to education an essential element of pbl

i never thought id have to leave my country because i was starving chef alberto alvarez told huffpost brazil food for him was always more than a means of survival it was his main work tool the

roraima looking for jobs and food to feed his family alvarez went to culinary school in montreal and lyon france before fleeing venezuela he worked at a topend restaurant in caracas where he lived with his wife and his two children ages 6 and 8 i had to find a solution we decided to come to brazil and start over he said when there is no food theres no use in knowing how to prepare it being able to speak english or french or having good memories from days past alvarez and his family are living with friends some days he can find the odd job such as painting houses but most of the time he relies on the generosity of others especially tourists to buy meals that cost a little over a dollar the alvarezes are among the 30700 people who have migrated from venezuela to brazil since last august according to the brazilian government in the same time period colombias migration office estimates that 870000 venezuelans entered the country they are fleeing violent unrest and food and medicine shortages in the last year alone venezuelans lost an average of 24 pounds due to hunger according to human rights watch the countrys infant mortality rates are back to 1990 levels and illnesses previously under control such as measles tuberculosis diphtheria and malaria are once again epidemic it is easier for venezuelan families to come to brazil unlike in colombia and peru theres no need to present a passport which is hard to obtain since the venezuelan government essentially stopped issuing them brazilians however speak portuguese which can be a challenge for the spanishspeaking venezuelans even though the border crossing has been officially closed on the venezuelan side since feb 22 asylum requests from people who manage to reach brazil are overwhelming the camps the brazilian army and unchr have set up in paracaima near the venezuelan border around 350 people arrive on slow days but more than 1000 can show up on a single busy day mayerlin gonzlez 23 made the trip with her husband ronni villalba 25 and their 10monthold son ronner they traveled for more than 30 hours first they took a bus then they walked through las trochas illegal routes controlled by armed groups and used by venezuelans fleeing the country gonzlezs husband had tried first he came to boa vista stayed for about a month living on the streets and found a job then he went back to maturn a venezuelan town 500 miles from paracaima to bring back his family gonzlez said she doesnt even think about going back to venezuela she wants to go further south into brazil paran santa catarina someplace far away from venezuela she said venezuelans see southern brazil as more prosperous because of the hardship theyve endured in northern brazilian cities like boa vista or manaus ricardo jose an uber driver whose mother is brazilian is among those who have moved to southeastern brazil two years ago jose 31 left his country to move to so paulo his parents and his uncles decided to stay leaving meant selling all their possessions for next to nothing he said before moving here my family was kidnapped more than once we left as soon as possible we didnt want for thing to get to a breaking point you cant trust anyone in my country he said the current protests in caracas are the beginning of the final phase of maduros regime guaido said on tuesday guaido currently has the support of brazil and the united states among other countries but maduro says he still has the support of venezuelas military jose has hopes in guaidos movement he was elected president by the representatives because he was the leader of congress he is the president representatives are entitled to pick the president he is our hope of bringing down maduros government the only hope is that the military joins the opposition and more people take to the streets to pressure the government he added the support of the military is crucial to force maduros hand he knew a confrontation was imminent and while it didnt happen he armed civilian groups to stand with his government for those still living in venezuela brazil is a source of everyday necessities like food and personal hygiene products every week pemon zoraide who declined to use her real name for safety reasons leaves the venezuelan village of kumarakapay 50 miles from the border with brazil to buy food on the other side in paracaima we buy all kinds of things theres nothing in venezuela its very bad she told huffpost brasil although her 9yearold son has witnessed the venezuelan army fatally shooting someone she still hasnt left the country her child has measles he needs to get better first she said earlier this month huffpost brasil took the same underground route that venezuelans use to reach brazil venezuelans use taxis in reality old cars in a bad state of repair for their trips from santa elena de uairen venezuela to paracaima across the border each leg of the trip costs 1250 on the way back if people are carrying a lot of supplies which is not uncommon it can cost almost 40 but some go on foot using trails alongside dirt roads or through the forest the brazilian army has set up stations at the end of these routes to provide water food and medical treatment huffpost brazil made the trip from paracaima to santa elena de uairen by car with a venezuelan couple who brought back bags and boxes filled with staples from butter to toilet paper under normal conditions the trip between the two cities usually takes no more than 30 minutes through las trochas the main unofficial route into brazil it took almost an hour the taxis cross the border a mile from the official border crossing at a makeshift crossing point the brazilian military doesnt ask for papers from the vehicles occupants since only the venezuelan side of the border is officially closed a little further we reach a dirt road in the comunidad indgena san antonio del morichal an indian reservation belonging to the pemontaurepang there the indigenous people their faces covered have their own checkpoint the car comes to a stop the driver shakes hand with a member of the indigenous community and we are on our way a little later another checkpoint and another handshake a few kilometers into venezuelan territory we reach an army checkpoint this time instead of shaking hands the driver hands the officer his drivers license and 50 reais 1250 in us dollars the military also mans the fourth and final checkpoint another 50 reais note and we are waved through we return to brazil in the same car this time occupied by two women and two children plus the driver we stop for fuel at a house along the road the gas comes from big jugs and is poured into the tank with the help of a plastic coke bottle crossing the military checkpoints on the way into brazil is not as easy as entering venezuela on our second check we are told we cant go on despite having paid the driver pleads his case with three officers and we continue the trip unsure of what the driver promised the venezuelan soldiers the profound crisis in venezuela is also changing things on the brazilian side of the border if we had 10000 sacks of flour wed sell them all said rone neto manager of comercial brasil one of paracaimas main food distributors he moved to the town four months ago to deal with the increasing business were opening a second store if you see one store right next to the other it might seem weird but theres room for everyone here theres huge demand no matter how much we have in inventory we sell it all the most indemand item is wheat flour we tend to think of rice and beans he said referring to brazilians but venezuelans are different they buy a lot of flour and butter shop owners may celebrate the increase in business but some residents have complaints more people were coming after each day the town changed completely said manoel soares owner of a restaurant in the town bus terminal he said the city was sheer tranquility before the venezuelans arrived paracaima was a hub for tourists looking for hikes waterfalls and a gateway to the tropical rainforest topographer ruy hagge barbosa 62 moved to paracaima 12 years ago and echoed those concerns it changed for the worse its chaos you barely see brazilians exchanging money in the main street only venezuelans they dont comply with our laws because they are immune from them across the border in venezuela santa elena de uairen looks now like a ghost town the dutyfree shopping center was one of the first to feel the consequences with the border closure and a dearth of goods brazilians looking for cheaper electronics and cosmetics stopped coming the shopping center is now closed and the area around it is deserted things are no different in the towns two main hotels the anaconda once a grand hotel has shut down the garibaldi in the city center has iron railings on its doors and the restaurant is permanently closed in the towns grocery stores the

worldnews ben cao speaks about his father as though the man is a living legend the 23yearold from charlotte north carolina says his father the rev john sanqiang cao is a passionate christian minister a devoted humanitarian and a man with absolutely no quit in him no matter the circumstances john cao is also apparently a master of dad jokes like the one he often tells about his chinese name which translates to three talents he loves to tell people the first talent is sleeping the second is eating and he hasnt quite figured out the third talent yet ben cao told huffpost about his dad but for more than a year ben cao has been unable to speak to his father at all john cao is a prominent figure in chinas house church movement a network of small unregistered congregations that operate independently of chinas statesanctioned religious institutions the pastor has been held in china since march 2017 when he was arrested while traveling back to the country from myanmar chinese officials charged him with organizing others to cross the border illegally a crime the associated press claimed is frequently used to indict human traffickers but john cao has crossed the border many times bringing volunteers from bible schools hes helped build in china over to his schools in myanmar without incident now he faces a sevenyear prison sentence which his family and supporters believe is an unwarranted punishment ben cao and his older brother amos cao are pleading with the chinese government to show their father mercy i am deeply saddened and devastated by the incarceration of my father ben cao said he is my mentor role model friend and support system the pastors arrest comes during a push by beijing to sinicize or make more chinese the countrys major religions removing perceived foreign influences and ensuring faith leaders loyalty to the communist government although the chinese constitution officially guarantees citizens religious freedom religion is highly regulated in the country the state recognizes both protestantism and catholicism but requires churches to register with one of three statesanctioned christian religious organizations while state churches ascribe to core christian doctrines they also require pastors to be politically loyal to the government and give moral sanction to its programs the government also maintains authority over the selection of clergy house churches operate outside of statesanctioned christianity meeting in smaller groups in living rooms factory buildings and restaurants a 2010 report from the pew research center suggested that 35 million of chinas 58 million protestants belonged to independent house churches the regulation of house churches is largely left up to local party officials some officials harass but ultimately tolerate these unregistered churches but in recent years the government has been exerting tighter control over house churches fearing that the independent religious groups could pose threats to the partys stability since at least 2015 government officials have detained christian leaders demolished churches and cracked down on christian gatherings and activities experts say john caos arrest could be part of the ruling partys attempts to exert authority over these independent christian churches john cao a 58yearold native of china converted to christianity in his 20s he married an american citizen and his two sons are also american citizens while he established a life in america attending seminary in new york and pastoring two chinese congregations in north carolina he felt called to be a missionary in his home country the pastor is a legal permanent resident of the us but kept his chinese citizenship in order to facilitate ease of travel in and out of china according to his supporters over the years he became a prominent figure in chinas house church movement he founded more than a dozen schools in central and southern china according to the associated press at these schools he reportedly gave students an education and training to be future christian missionaries around 2014 the pastor began to turn his attention to the neighboring country of myanmar more than 50 of his chinese trainees volunteered to travel with john cao to myanmar as he expanded and built 16 schools there xi lian an expert in chinese christianity at duke university said that there are ethnic minority populations in the yunnan province that live along the border between china and myanmar historically there has been a strong and warm response to christianity among those minority peoples lian told huffpost that is a main reason for contemporary missionary work in the area ben cao said his fathers work in myanmar was focused more on charity and humanitarian aid than the religious work he did in china he dedicated three years of his life from 2014 to 2017 to providing clothes food water shelter education and spirituality to the minority groups in the mountains of myanmar ben cao told huffpost he added that his father did not attempt to hide border crossings in which he went from yunnan province to myanmars wa region from chinese authorities john cao often made the short 30foot trip across a river on a bamboo raft in broad daylight per the ap the pastor was frequently called in to meet with chinese security agents about his work with volunteers in myanmar john caos son believes that his father was doing what he thought was right although my father technically broke a chinese law there were no secrets no illegal arrangements and no traces of wrongdoing ben cao said he had been conducting business in myanmar for three years without any trouble from chinese authorities my father claims that the authorities were aware of their operation in myanmar and even helped them cross the border on occasion john caos journey on march 5 2017 didnt end like his previous trips on his way back to china from myanmar with a fellow teacher the pastor was arrested by chinese security agents he was sentenced in march 2018 to seven years in prison a decision his lawyer is currently appealing the chinese embassy in the us did not respond to multiple requests for comment on johns arrest lian of duke university told huffpost that johns arrest and imprisonment is unprecedented in recent chinese history we dont know exactly what message the chinese government is trying to send i suspect it is tied to the broader nationwide efforts to stop the momentum of the protestant movement in todays china lian said it may also have to do with enforcing the national boundary which it sees as being undermined by the border crossings of minority peoples whose ethnic and cultural identity takes precedence over their national identity and their loyalty to the chinese state lian added that it has been harder in recent years for chinese christians to practice their faith freely outside official statesanctioned churches chinaaid an american watchdog group that analyzes religious freedom in china says that religious persecution against chinese christians has increased in recent years in a 2016 report the group claimed that more than 1800 church leaders were detained in china that year while another 303 were sentenced to prison terms brynne lawrence a english editor for chinaaid told huffpost that johns arrest is definitely indicative of a wider crackdown on house churches especially since the crime he was charged with is more commonly applied to child traffickers moreover pastor cao had crossed that border many times before and had done nothing to cause arrest lawrence told huffpost william nee a china researcher for amnesty international told huffpost that john caos sentence of seven years seems vastly disproportionate to any offense the pastor may have committed he hypothesized that it could be meant as a political warning to others the arrest of john sanqiang cao is almost certainly related to a much broader crackdown on christianity in china and the governments attempts to limit missionary activities and any forms of religion not under government control nee told huffpost in an email it is tragic that a pastor engaging in humanitarian work could get swept up in such a politicized campaign this february the government enacted new regulations on religion including restricting chinese nationals from leaving the country for religious purposes without government authorization pastors of underground churches have reportedly been prevented from leaving mainland china altogether according to the ap its part of the overall drive of the state to sinicize christianity by limiting the ability of the chinese church to connect with western christianity lian said a state department spokesperson told huffpost that it is deeply concerned about john caos sevenyear sentence the spokesperson said state department officials met with the pastors wife when she visited chinas yunnan province to try to see her husband and submit requests to chinese officials about his case mr caos humanitarian work to build schools and deliver food has contributed to poverty alleviation in poor rural areas mr cao is nearly 60 years old and his health is deteriorating the spokesperson wrote in an email we continue to urge chinese authorities to release mr cao immediately on time served and humanitarian grounds and allow him to reunite with his family ben cao said that before the arrest his dad had planned to retire from missionary work after this trip to china he added his father was well aware of the risks associated with missionary work in the country he always knew risk of advocating religious freedom in china but his bravery and perseverance ended up costing him his freedom ben cao said the son said his familys next steps are to continue raising awareness about his dads situation and about threats to religious freedom worldwide he said he hopes to see china relax its restrictions on religions and have an open mind when discussing the coexistence of religion and the chinese communist party ben cao said he wants the us government to negotiate his dads unconditional release i would love to see a response from president donald trump ben cao said and although the pastor is miles away in a chinese prison ben said he wants his dad to remain hopeful i hope he remembers how much his children love him and i hope he is being treated kindly fairly and with dignity ben cao said my father is a great man in a world where great men are few and far between

technology facebook wants out of the news business the company announced thursday that it is shuttering paper a relatively obscure ios app that displayed facebooks news feed differently emphasizing media and news articles the app contained topic pages like tech for instance and tapping on those sections would display a series of related stories for you to interact with by friday paper had already been removed from the app store and its official website was scrubbed from the internet the decision to dump paper comes immediately after a highly publicized announcement from facebook this week that it will prioritize posts from your friends above those from pages a catchall term for media outlets and brands that use the social network to connect to their audiences if you wonder whether the two might be connected consider wireds original review of the paper app in 2014 the most radical aspect of paper though is that it isnt predicated entirely on your friends kyle vanhemert wrote by expanding the scope and quality of content you can expect to find there paper is trying to position itself as a place youll go for news and inspirationand just as importantly as the kind of place youll want to contribute to yourself he added news at the expense of friends is the last thing facebook wants now as we learned from the algorithm shift earlier this week yes the company has closed down plenty of services before in vanity fair this month a former employee describes a crowded graveyard of forgotten facebook product failures but papers demise is just the latest item in a trend the apps death follows a dust up over facebooks supposed bias against conservative news in its trending topics module after that facebook met with members of the conservative media and politicians to assuage their ire and overhauled the companys guidelines on how trending news items are selected the message couldnt be more clear facebook is in retreat from the notion that its a news service and even before the social network altered its news feed algorithm to prioritize live video content from people and brands which sent media outlets many of which profit from the firehose of traffic facebook can provide into a panic news that facebook is paying companies including the huffington post to create live programs did little to quell fears over the future of the written word nor did a blunt statement from facebook executive nicola mendelsohn about the social network being all video within five years more than a year before mendelsohns declaration the social network enacted an algorithm shift that highlighted personal content though the language in that update emphasized balance between those posts and others not so anymore the message couldnt be more clear facebook is in retreat from the notion that its a news service and it wants to cement its reputation as a place where people connect with other people not brands perhaps thats because facebook is losing ground not so long ago if you wanted to post a personal story or photo online facebook was the place to do it then your mom joined and your boyfriends weird aunt you got a friend request from your high school principal its nice to be connected to everyone but sometimes you just want to post your keg stand in peace enter snapchat which has swiftly climbed in popularity over the last two years especially with people between the ages of 18 and 34 the platform offers total control over who you share content with and that content automatically deletes itself after viewing its a stark contrast to facebooks confusing privacy controls and overall permanence while snapchat rose facebook is said to have suffered a significant decline in personal sharing on its network meaning people like you and me are posting less about our lives a report on thursday indicated that much the same thing has happened on facebookowned instagram the bottom line facebook is doing what it can to stay relevant and exert more control over its more than 1 billion users today that means pivoting away from the fickle news media and doing more to encourage people to talk to one another without branded noise gumming

worldnews washingtonseoul may 25 reuters us president donald trump on friday dangled the possibility that a june 12 summit with north koreas leader kim jong un could still take place just a day after he canceled the meeting citing pyongyangs open hostility trump indicated the summit could be salvaged after welcoming a conciliatory statement from north korea saying it remained open to talks it was a very nice statement they put out trump told reporters at the white house well see what happens it could even be the 12th were talking to them now they very much want to do it wed like to do it after years of tension over pyongyangs nuclear weapons program kim and trump agreed this month to hold what would be the first meeting between a serving us president and a north korean leader the plan followed months of war threats and insults between the leaders over north koreas development of missiles capable of reaching the united states trump scrapped the meeting planned for singapore in a letter to kim on thursday after repeated threats by north korea to pull out over what it saw as confrontational remarks by us officials demanding unilateral disarmament trump cited north korean hostility in canceling the summit in pyongyang north korean vice foreign minister kim kye gwan said north koreas criticisms had been a reaction to american rhetoric and that current antagonism showed the urgent necessity for the summit he said north korea regretted trumps decision to cancel and remained open to resolving issues regardless of ways at any time kim kye gwan said north korea had appreciated trump having made the bold decision to work toward a summit we even inwardly hoped that what is called trump formula would help clear both sides of their worries and comply with the requirements of our side and would be a wise way of substantial effect for settling the issue he said trumps latest aboutface sent officials scrambling in washington defense secretary jim mattis told reporters diplomats were still at work and said trump had just sent a note out on the summit which could be back on if our diplomats can pull it off us state department spokeswoman katina adams declined to give details of any diplomatic contacts but said as the president said in his letter to chairman kim dialog between the two is the only dialog that matters if north korea is serious then we look forward hearing from them at the highest levels white house spokeswoman sarah sanders told reporters trump did not want a meeting that was just a political stunt he wants to get something thats a longlasting and an actual real solution and if they are they are ready to do that then were certainly ready to have those conversations she said if the meeting takes place on june 12 well be ready if it takes place on july 12 we will be ready sanders indicated it had yet to be decided whether white house officials would stick to a plan to travel to singapore in coming days to prepare the summit north korea had sharply criticized suggestions by trumps national security adviser john bolton and vice president mike pence that it could share the fate of libya if it did not swiftly surrender its nuclear arsenal libyan leader muammar gaddafi was deposed and killed by natobacked militants after halting his nascent nuclear program trump had initially sought to placate north korea saying he was not pursuing the libya model and sanders said he was following the president trump model us regional allies japan and south korea as well as north koreas main ally china urged the two countries to salvage the summit on friday at an economic forum in st petersburg chinese vice president wang qishan said it was necessary to ensure security on the korean peninsula which touched on chinas core interests japanese prime minister shinzo abe at the same forum regretted the cancellation and said the world should keep doing its bit to make the summit happen south korea also would continue efforts to improve ties with the north the office of president moon jaein said after moons top security advisers met for the second time on friday some analysts worried that canceling the summit could prompt a resumption in hostilities including renewed shorterrange missile tests or steppedup cyber attacks by pyongyang and increased sanctions or deployment of new military assets by washington in his letter trump warned kim of the united states greater nuclear might reminiscent of his tweet last year asserting that he had a much bigger nuclear button than kim while the trump administration had insisted on north koreas complete verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear program pyongyang had always couched its language in terms of denuclearization of the korean peninsula it has said in previous failed talks that it could consider giving up its arsenal if the united states provided security guarantees by removing its troops from south korea and withdrawing its socalled nuclear umbrella of deterrence from south korea and japan additional reporting by doina chiacu idrees ali david brunnstrom and matt spetalnick in washington christian lowe denis pinchuk

science humans may be smart because energy once devoted to brawn was given up for brains researchers say the most powerful computer known is the brain the human brain possesses about 100 billion neurons with about 1 quadrillion 1 million billion connections known as synapses wiring these cells together humans possess more complex powerful brains than humanitys closest living relatives such as monkeys and apes one reason behind this jump in brainpower may lie in how much of the human metabolism is devoted to the human brain it consumes a whopping 20 percent of the bodys total energy 10 surprising facts about the human brain to gain insights into how the human brain evolved scientists compared the metabolisms of humans and animals such as chimpanzees mice and rhesus monkeys they focused on how much energy each species devoted to the brain and body the researchers analyzed more than 10000 compounds known as metabolites which are small molecules formed by or necessary to metabolism such as sugars and fats the building blocks of proteins dna and cell membranes and chemical signals given off by cells they investigated metabolite levels in the kidney thigh muscle and three brain regions the primary visual cortex which is involved in vision the cerebellar cortex which helps coordinate muscular activity and the prefrontal cortex which plays a major role in complex mental behavior decision making and social behavior the investigators next compared how much the metabolisms of these animals differed with how far apart these species are evolutionarily by analyzing human and other genomes prior studies revealed when the ancestors of humans and other animals diverged for instance the ancestors of humans and rodents diverged about 75 million years ago while divergence happened about 25 million years ago with the ancestors of rhesus monkeys and about 6 million years ago with the ancestors of chimpanzees for the most part the scientists found the levels of differences between the metabolisms of these species matched how far apart they were evolutionarily the further apart evolutionarily the greater the metabolism differences were however they discovered the rate of change in the metabolism of the human prefrontal cortex was about four times faster than that of chimpanzees even more surprisingly the rate of change in the metabolism of human muscle was more than eight times faster that that of the chimpanzee even after so many years of research of humans and human evolution we still can uncover large unknown differences between humans and other species said study author philipp khaitovich an evolutionary biologist at the chinese academy of sciences key laboratory of computational biology in shanghai to rule out the possibility that these changes simply reflected the modern human couch potato lifestyle the scientists performed additional experiments on rhesus monkeys moving them from a spacious countryside facility to small indoor homes and serving them fatty and sugary food for several weeks all to imitate the environment and behavior of contemporary humans these lifestyle changes had only a small effect on the metabolisms of the monkeys muscles for a long time we were confused by metabolic changes in human muscle until we realized that what other primates have in common in contrast to humans is their enormous muscle strength said lead author katarzyna bozek of the chinese academy of sciences key laboratory of computational biology in shanghai the 7 biggest mysteries of the human body chimps are far stronger than humans kevin hunt director of the human origins and primate evolution lab at indiana university once told of watching an 85pound 385 kilograms female chimp in africa snap branches off an ironwood tree with her fingertips one that took hunt two hands and all his strength to break to see just how much stronger chimps and rhesus monkeys are than humans the researchers conducted muscle strength tests that involved pulling weights upward all of the human volunteers in the experiment who included professional athletes were outcompeted by their primate opponents by more than twofold according to our results an average adult chimpanzee is approximately two to three times stronger than an average adult human khaitovich told live science the fact that metabolic changes in human muscle are paralleled by a drastic reduction in muscle strength leads the researchers to hint that human ancestors may have swapped brains for brawn it is a very simple explanation and it could be completely wrong khaitovich said in evolution however simple explanations often work well our work opens a door to further studies of human metabolic uniqueness khaitovich said it is a huge field that is virtually untouched by scientists the scientists detailed their findings online today may 27 in the journal plos biology follow us livescience facebook google original article on live science

politics a rare democrat in a deeply republican state us rep sharice davids of kansas is one of the most vulnerable incumbents seeking reelection this year in the final months of her congressional campaign she is focusing on republicans strict opposition to abortion rights an online ad she released last week highlights how amanda adkins the republican favored to emerge from tuesdays primary for a rematch with david in november opposed abortion without exceptions the ad points to adkins support of an amendment to the kansas constitution on the ballot tuesday that would make clear there is no right to abortion in the states there were a lot of people who would not have known that i have an opponent who is extreme on this issue davids who beat adkins in 2020 said in an interview its not hypothetical anymore thats a sign of how the supreme courts decision in june to repeal a womans federal constitutional right to abortion has scrambled the political dynamics heading into the fall elections when control of congress is at stake a halfdozen of the most vulnerable house members all of them women all representing swaths of suburban voters see the issue as one that could help them win in an otherwise difficult political climate in addition to davids these incumbents include reps angie craig of minnesota cindy axne of iowa elissa slotkin of michigan abigail spanberger and elaine luria of virginia and susan wilds of pennsylvania they all face republican opponents who support the high courts abortion ruling some are contending with rivals who back efforts to ban abortion in all circumstances including when the mothers life is at risk its unclear whether the focus on abortion alone may be enough to mean reelection for many of these democrats who are running at a time of high inflation and frustration with president joe bidens performance in a close tossup election which i think all of these are it can make a difference said national pollster christine matthews a selfdescribed moderate who has worked for republicans its not going to be what drives everyone to make a vote choice but it will drive some people to make a vote choice twentytwo percent of us adults named abortion or womens rights in an openended question as one of up to five problems they want the government to address in the next year according to an associated pressnorc center for public affairs research poll conducted in june that has more than doubled since december since the supreme court decision as state governments have moved to act on abortion rights apnorc polling has found a majority of people in the united states saying they want congress to pass legislation guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide overwhelming majorities also think states should allow abortion in specific cases including if the health of the pregnant woman is endangered or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest like those questioned overall a majority of suburbanites think abortion should be legal in most or all cases according to apnorc polling suburbanites also were slightly more likely than city residents and significantly more likely than people living in rural areas to say abortion or womens rights are among the top issues for the government to address according to the apnorc poll from june thats particularly important in districts such as axnes in iowa which includes des moines teeming suburbs dallas county west of des moines has been one of the countrys fastestgrowing counties since 2000 with the cornfields from decades ago now covered in new homes schools and commercial developments in an interview axne was adamant that she would make abortion a central theme of her campaign axnes gop opponent is state rep zach nunn who indicated in a primary debate that he opposes abortion without exceptions i cant even believe i have to say this i have an opponent who would let a woman die to bear a child axne said this is crap we dont see in this country this is the stuff we talk about in other countries and women not having rights in michigan rep elissa slotkin faces state sen tom barrett who supports only an exception to save a womans life thats more extreme than the 1931 law thats on our books slotkin said in an interview so i think that thats an important contrast to make the adkins barrett and nunn campaigns did not reply to telephone email and text messages seeking comment for this story in virginia yesli vega the republican challenging spanberger in a district that spans the suburbs of washington dc and richmond has not dismissed the debunked theory that pregnancy is unlikely in cases of rape in audio published by axios late last month vega was asked during a campaign event in may whether its harder for a woman to get pregnant if shes been raped vega responded axios reported maybe because theres so much going on in the body i dont know i havent seen any studies but if im processing what youre saying it wouldnt surprise me because its not something thats happening organically right youre forcing it the answer was reminiscent of what todd akin a missouri congressman who was the republican nominee for senate in 2012 said during that campaign in discussing his opposition to exceptions for rape victims akin claimed if its legitimate rape the female body has ways to try to shut the whole thing down the comments were viewed as a major contributor to his loss to democrat clare mccaskill a vulnerable incumbent in virginia spanberger released a digital ad last week declaring that vegas views dont

social we have always paid public servants a flat fee untethered to any sort of performance measures thats because we want public service to be completely disconnected from any private interests imagine if for instance we paid fire fighters on sliding scale based on how many of which type fires they put out at a certain speed this would be disastrous for many reasons fire fighters would refuse to work in cities where there were few fires to fight because they couldnt make a living in cities where there were commonly multiple fires and their livelihood on the line fire fighters would be encouraged to look at each fire call through a lens of whats in it for me for instance in a system where fire fighters were paid based on the value of the flamebesieged property fire fighters might view some small building fires as not worth the trouble why bother traveling to the other side of the tracks its only a hundreddollar blaze anyway lets wait till something breaks out up in the milliondollar neighborhood in the worstcase scenario one of our fire fighters depending on performancebased pay to feed his family may be tempted to grab some matches and go fire up some business occasionally weve seen these kinds of perverse incentives in action and we dont much like it the areas of the country where you take extra speed limit care at the end of the month because the local police have a quota to meet the neighborhood where cops have to roust a certain number of suspects a week to keep their job ratings nobody thinks these are examples of excellence in public service in fact we have tried private police forces and private fire companies in the past we dont much care for how that works out because it creates a system that provides excellent service but only for the customers who are paying for it the idea of public service is to create a class of people who are above selfinterest and who do not respond to a single boss we are outraged when abuse of police power happens precisely because we expect the police to act as if they work for everyone and to put their dedication to that service above any single interests including their own thats the definition of public service service roles that are stripped of any possibility of incentives other than the mandate to serve the public good thats what we mean by professional a person who puts all personal selfinterest aside and focuses on getting the job done trying to motivate a public servant with selfinterest inevitably tends to pollute the professional setting with the very selfinterest that were trying to get out of there heres the thing about performance incentives they always come from actual individual humans in business thats okay because the humans are already the bosses in public service we often talk about performance incentives as if they fall from the sky descending fullyformed from some onhigh objective source they are not they too are developed by actual individual humans and those humans will invariably encode their own values and priorities into the incentives i like red houses i think they are more valuable say our fire company evaluators thats why i live in one and thats why a good fire company always gives priority to saving red houses first performance incentives for public service always always involve substituting the values of the few for the values of everybody fire fighters are supposed to save everybodys homes police are supposed to protect every citizen the us postal service is supposed to deliver to every home they are there to serve the public and that means everybody public schools are supposed to educate all students public servants are supposed to support the values of all citizens any performance based evaluation reward system will prioritize some citizens values over those of other citizens a public service performance based incentive system in action you know which public servants have a fullyrealized performancebased pay system in place the ceo of international whoomdinglers says that senator bogswaller has done an excellent job of looking out for the things we believe are important he ought to keep his job send him a big fat check the head of the society for preservation of freerange spongemonkeys says we appreciate the hard work that representative whangdoodle has done looking out for spongemonkeys he deserves a raise send him a big fat check you and the members of the supreme court who are paying attention might call this corruption but its just a performance based incentive system and the high regard with which congress is held tells you how well a pbis mixes with public service but a performance based incentive system put in place by the government would not be run like the hodgepodge of private interests you describe incentivizing the us congress you say and i say baloney we already have a performance based incentive system that says youre a better school district if you sell more of the college boards ap product line the pbis testing system being used to incentivize students and teachers and schools that system is entirely a product of private corporate interests the only difference between a private incentive system like the one that runs congress and a public one like race to the top is whether the people with money and power have to manipulate a government middle man or can go straight to the source i teach mostly juniors sometimes seniors there are a few things i tell them every year one is to make the most out of senior year because it is the last time they will be surrounded by people who are paid to put the students interests first its the last time theyll be in an institution that is organized around their concerns their interests their needs after that theyre in the open market they will always be dealing with people who are trying to sell them something the psat will collect a ton of information about them so it can turn around and sell that data to colleges colleges will try to sell them particularly if they are highly desirable students employers will try to get the use of their talents without having to pay much for it and politicians will piss on them and tell them its raining so that the pols can keep their jobs but here under the umbrella of the public school my students have nothing that i need to survive or make a living i have no reason to do this job except for the reason i took this job in the first place to serve the best interests of my students it doesnt make any difference it makes businessoriented reformy types crazy that the way i do my job doesnt make any difference to my pay i understand the terror for them there but that not making a difference is actually the point of how we pay public servants it doesnt matter its a big fire or a small fire a rich persons house or a poor persons house the fire department still does their job it doesnt matter whether i have a classroom full of bright students or slow students rich students or poor students ambitious students or lazy students i will still show up and do my job the best i know how i should never ever ever have to look at a class roster or a set of test results or a practice quiz and think dammit these kids are going to keep me from making my house payment next month i should never view my students as an obstacle to feeding my family why i wont suck reformsters are sure that human beings must be motivated by threats and rewards and that the lack of threats and rewards means that i can too easily choose to do a crappy job because it wont make any difference they are wrong heres why 1 i knew the gig when i started i knew i would not get rich not be powerful not have a chance to rise to some position of prominence there was no reason to enter teaching in the first except a desire to do right by the students 2 teaching is too hard to do halfassed do a consistently lousy job and the students will eat you alive and dragging yourself out of bed every day will be too damn much there isnt enough money to keep people flailing badly in a classroom for a lifetime just ask all the tfa dropouts who said damn this is hella hard and left the classroom threats and rewards do not make people better public servants nor have i ever seen a lick of research that suggests otherwise but feel free to review this oftlinked video re motivation threats and rewards interfere with peoples ability to get their job done threats and rewards motivate people to game the system and any time you have a complex system being measured with simple instruments you have a system that is ripe for gaming in fact if your measures are bad enough looking at you high stakes tests and vam your system can only be successfully operated by gaming it heck no you need to keep an eye out for the grossly incompetent though they will often selfidentify ive made a huge mistake and take the next stage out of dodge beyond that you just go watch and pay attention if youre my administration youre welcome in my classroom at any time for as long as youd like to stay no dont bring that stupid checklist just watch and listen and use your professional judgment if you think i need to fix something lets you and i talk about it how will bringing in extra layers of bureaucracy and government make that system work any more smoothly agreed sometimes these posts get away from me bottom line the comparison to private enterprise performance based incentive systems is bogus those systems may be appropriate in corporate environments where we want to enforce a bias in favor of certain actors and outcomes where some people are in fact more important than others but in public service performance based incentive systems are contraindicated they by nature enforce a particular bias and cannot help but tilt the system in favor of some customers over others performance based systems are an invitation to ignore the clients who keep you from making bank the system we have does in fact make sense we stand our public servants beside a door and we say im going to pay you to stand here and wait as long as it takes and help whoever comes through that door it doesnt matter who comes through that door nothing is going to affect your pay so thats a settled and done deal just concentrate on watching that door and helping whoever walks through it god bless you feel free to chime in in the comments

social as a teacher the one idiom that irritates me to no end is those that can do those that cant teach unfortunately george bernard shaw did not create this sentiment but only helped to give it voice but shaws infamous line does serve as a window into the perceptions of many into the profession of teaching it makes me wonder why arent teachers viewed as experts as unpopular as i feel this may sound i think we as teachers must recognize aspects of how we have traditionally gone about our work that has contributed to this sentiment i see three main issues in a recent conversation i had with sean mccomb 2014 national teacher of the year he proposed an approach that would remove the mystery of what happens in the classroom invite policy and decision makers into our classrooms by having legislators and policy writers experience firsthand the realities of the classroom we as a profession can better influence the decisions that are made throughout our system have you invited your superintendent into your classroom your local congressman a board of education member not ready to invite guests into your classroom well there are other steps to make our work transparent blogging i know i know you are probably rolling your eyes at this point but hear me out for a second writing and publicly sharing what happens in our classrooms demonstrates to the world that learning is at the heart of a classroom it makes public the messiness of the classroom it shows the world that we are indeed practitioners it demonstrates that we are focused on growth there is also another benefit people might give you feedback and we might all grow together 2 abdication closely linked to a lack of transparency is the fact that we have abdicated many of the decisions that are made about teaching and learning while we rely on our elected officials to make decisions for constituents and education is a national political issue do we as teachers actively engage in a solutionsoriented manner for this end to do so it requires proactive instead of reactionary thinking we must become practitioners of actionresearch in order to learn for ourselves whats best for our students and classrooms for too long we have relied on experts to train a workforce to help others learn we must be the lead learners in order to impact our craft and student outcomes but most importantly to inform and influence the legislative and policy decisions that are being made for us when it comes to the reimagining that our schools need we are mired in the models of the past these experiences that confine our own schema are difficult to overcome but in order to change the experience that school needs to be for todays students we must be willing to question everything we settle for repurposed tools and experiences that never really worked to begin with but provide us with a certain level of comfort and security i know the common idiom is dont let perfect become the enemy of good but i believe in education we practice dont let better happen because we are good enough we must continue to strive for better we must consistently be willing to analyze our programs and strategies and techniques in order to assess their effectiveness i know all of these ideas probably arent popular but i would like to engage in a conversation about what we as teachers can do to improve our profession how do we transition from a job to a profession how do we do a better job at working together for the behalf of all students how should we engage with others to improve outcomes for all

sports arod wont be back any time soon but he will be eligible to return to the field a bit earlier than major league baseball intended independent arbitrator fredric horowitz notified alex rodriguez mlb and the players union on saturday that he had reduced the threetime american league mvps suspension from 211 games to 162 such a ban will sideline rodriguez for the entire 2014 regular season for violations of mlbs drug agreement and labor contract horowitzs ruling will also keep rodriguez from participating in the 2014 postseason should the new york yankees qualify mlbs independent arbitrator since june 2012 horowitz heard arods case over several contentious sessions that began during the 2013 season for more than five decades the arbitration process under the basic agreement has been a fair and effective mechanism for resolving disputes and protecting player rights mlb said in a statement via mlbcom while we believe the original 211game suspension was appropriate we respect the decision rendered by the panel and will focus on our continuing efforts on eliminating performanceenhancing substances from our game rodriguez had been hit with the historic 211game ban in august for his involvement with biogenesis a closed antiaging clinic in miami accused of dispensing performanceenhancing drugs to several players the 38yearold third baseman was among more than a dozen players disciplined in the biogenesis scandal but the only one still fighting his ban in a statement released on saturday rodriguez denied using performanceenhancing drugs and vowed to continue fighting his suspension in federal court i have been clear that i did not use performance enhancing substances as alleged in the notice of discipline or violate the basic agreement or the joint drug agreement in any manner and in order to prove it i will take this fight to federal court rodriguez said in a statement released to the new york daily news i am confident that when a federal judge reviews the entirety of the record the hearsay testimony of a criminal whose own records demonstrate that he dealt drugs to minors and the lack of credible evidence put forth by mlb that the judge will find that the panel blatantly disregarded the law and facts and will overturn the suspension the major league baseball players association also released a statement following the announcement of the arbitration decision while the mlbpa disagreed with the result of the arbitration process its statement implied it would not be helping rodriguez pursue the matter in federal court the mlbpa strongly disagrees with the award issued today in the grievance of alex rodriguez even despite the arbitration panels decision to reduce the duration of mr rodriguezs unprecedented 211game suspension the mlb pa said in a statement released to mlbcom we recognize that a final and binding decision has been reached however and we respect the collectively bargained arbitration process which led to the decision in accordance with the confidentiality provisions of the jda the association will make no further comment regarding the decision
technology dear silicon valley youd have more success recruiting black people if you actually supported the black community thats one powerful takeaway of a damning essay titled silicon valley doesnt care about black people published wednesday night on medium after the news broke that yet another black man philando castile had been killed by police in minnesota barely two days after police fatally shot anton sterling also black in baton rouge louisiana in recent years tech companies have issued report after report acknowledging that very few people of color work in silicon valley and pledging to do better more than a few tech ceos are out there talking about how eager they are to recruit more men and women of color but when black people are gunned down by police in the united states these companies tend to stay silent justin edmund a former product designer at pinterest wrote wednesday it stands out just how mute silicon valley is when it comes to unarmed black people being shot and killed by cops edmund wrote its alarming considering this very same industry is actively trying to court underrepresented minorities for technical positions to make their workforce diversity statistics look less homogeneously white indeed on thursday facebook was criticized for removing a video posted by diamond reynolds castiles girlfriend facebook later reposted the video with a graphic content warning but didnt offer much of an explanation for the whole thing edmund called out silicon valley not just because of the industrys supposed commitment to diversity but because when these companies take a stand on an issue they tend to have an effect consider the way companies like paypal apple and salesforce have been outspoken about lgbtq rights not only have chief executives like apples tim cook and salesforces marc benioff made forceful statements supporting equality but some of these companies have also pulled their business from states with discriminatory laws in indiana a group of tech companies successfully pushed to get a law repealed that had permitted discrimination against gay people silicon valley was as far as i know one of the first industries to treat lgbtq individuals like people and look how far weve come on that front edmund writes however muted the tech industry has been on police violence its played a pivotal role in at least one way technology has been absolutely critical in exposing police brutality to the world after police shot castile in a suburb of st paul on wednesday reynolds filmed a graphic video of the aftermath and posted it on facebook live when a police officer shot and killed michael brown in 2014 the world watched videos of the subsequent protests in ferguson missouri and the heavily militarized police response via vine videos on twitter disclosure the huffington post is one of several brands that facebook pays to broadcast live video content via the social network and of course the black lives matter movement has gained widespread amplification on twitter a critical platform for the black community at the same time only 2 percent of twitter employees are actually black on thursday several influential people in the tech world shared edmunds post please read silicon valley doesnt care about black people by jedmund httpstco6nuzkc0vvd anil dash a tech entrepreneur based in new york took it one step further noting that certain companies are essentially profiting from police violence as people use their products and services to document instances of brutality police violence is yielding a huge windfall for tech companies like dropcam gopro this obligates them to speak up and act to end it every single story about philandocastile mentions facebook their lack of action on police violence complicity in it is inexcusable gopro and nest labs which acquired dropcam in 2014 didnt immediately respond to requests for comment for this article but lets hope executives throughout silicon valley are paying attention update in a facebook post on thursday night mark zuckerberg offered his condolences to the castile family and said this weeks police shooting videos shine a light on the fear that millions

technology americans love the internet some love it so much that theyd rather chop off a finger than stay offline forever according to a new survey in march researchers at att asked over 2000 americans what theyd give up to stay connected and people admitted that theyd part with some pretty essential things their answers which are meant to be more fun than scientific illustrate the extent to which the internet has become a nearly indispensable feature of modern life a full third of respondents said they would sacrifice a digit another third said theyd ditch their sense of taste more than 15 percent of the people surveyed said theyd forgo human interaction before ditching the internet and nearly 20 percent said theyd give up love over half said they would allow a stranger to die if it meant holding onto their internet connection and a measly 35 percent said they would give up the internet if doing so would allow them to cure cancer overall men reported being more willing than women to part with things like body parts or their morality younger respondents placed a higher value on internet access than older folks while these findings might suggest that americans are coldhearted internet fiends online access is actually essential for a growing number of everyday activities from shopping to applying for jobs to communicating with friends not having access to the internet or the ability to use it well can come with significant personal and financial costs we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again atts findings are provocative but they should be taken with a grain or a handful of salt the researchers polled people from all 50 states and the district of columbia but their findings arent nationally representative according to a company spokesperson so its impossible to tell whether the results reflect the opinions of americans as a whole it also didnt control for race income or location in 2013 a similar study found that 85 percent of respondents would rather go without water than give up mobile apps a 2015 pew study painted a less extreme picture it found that for nearly 70 percent of americans not having internet access at home would be a major disadvantage in finding a job and accessing important health data and other information

health when i was in college i looked into joining a sorority i searched youtube to learn more about the different sororities and i found that one of the sororities had a video interpretation of tj sullivans you are always wearing your letters tj sullivans words truly fascinated me in short he explained that once you join a fraternity or sorority you are always representing the past present and future members of the organization and you are putting the letters into your heart for the rest of your life the same is true of disabled people especially autistic people however unlike those who accept offers to join fraternities and sororities we dont get to sign a contract to undertake the great responsibility of always wearing your letters after we get that first tshirt go to a party or get initiated into the club after a ceremony rooted in years of tradition we dont get to choose membership into an autism or disability diagnosis club but we do get to choose membership into the supportive communities that surround our shared heritages and experiences we are given the lives we live and how we choose to live our lives determines how wearing our identities to the outside world pans out our identities arent always proudly displayed on tshirts pride flags buttons on backpacks or tattooed on our foreheads but they are part of us just the same and they are visible more often than we like to believe invisible disability isnt always invisible no matter where i go in life it is safe to say that people will know i am autistic and that is a life decision i have proudly and happily made whether or not i like it or choose it i have a lot of responsibility in my everyday life as a woman on the autism spectrum and an even greater responsibility by being open about being autistic part of community or team membership is having your teammates backs i am expected to carry myself a certain way to contribute to my team i am expected to be adequately educated on autism for any outsider who peppers me with questions somebody elses perception of me will influence their perception of the entire autism community every good thing i do could reflect well on us a mistake of mine could reflect poorly on our social skills or us as people instead of wearing sorority letters i am always wearing the autistic badge of responsibility i am responsible for wielding knowledge about myself and my community as power that knowledge and power is also a tool to educate those who come into contact with me i am responsible for a deep sense of selfawareness and having words for things that people dont normally think about or dont know i am responsible for the fact that how i conduct myself reflects on the millions of autistic people around the world even if that isnt something i am actively thinking about for many people i am the first autistic person they meet with that comes the great responsibility of wearing the autistic badge of responsibility what i say about autism and how i conduct myself will ultimately determine that persons entire perception and opinion of autistic people humans naturally stereotype stereotyping isnt always negative however i can encourage positive ideas about people on the autism spectrum your stereotype of autistic people might come from a family friend or the media unfortunately autistic people get a bad rap in the media we only just got an autistic actor playing an autistic character in a broadway show hateful rhetoric is spewed constantly some typical people even throw autistic around as an insult akin to the rword people see us as objects of inspiration apathetic robots dangerous people or dustin hoffmans character in rain man this community is more than all of those stereotypes but what i say or do could determine whether or not you see this community as deserving of pity or deserving of respect that is where the duty and pressure of representation from wearing the autistic badge of responsibility comes from we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your

our letters our autistic badges of responsibility we get a lot of empowerment because we get to determine the narrative on autism going forward just by living our truths but we have a lot of responsibility about education and our own selfawareness it should not be any one persons job to change the world or to revolutionize stereotypes and stigma but to others outside of us it sometimes is ive learned that this is true for many marginalized folks sometimes it is my job to represent everyone because i will be the first point of contact with the autistic community someone gets and that idea of me influences that persons idea of millions of other people its a lot of work its a lot of pressure to be accountable for the good the bad and the ugly that comes with being autistic but it is also the most valuable and important thing i could do for autistic people who came before me people who are autistic and proud today people who are autistic and quiet today and autistic people who have yet to exist we are always wearing our letters our badges of responsibility and they are always on display to the world

science dung beetle brains are built so they can navigate day or night dung beetles spend their days collecting other animals poop to feed on while they may not seem like the most elegant of creatures it turns out their brains are impressively sophisticated a study published monday in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences reveals the specific brain mechanism in dung beetles that enables them to navigate their environments while simultaneously pushing around giant balls of poop scientists have long known that dung beetles use the sky to navigate they are guided by the sun during the day and by the moon or milky way during the night but the new research reveals exactly how the beetle brains builtin gps systems use these cues sometimes in neuroscience we forget that were meant to be investigating how the brains of animals create behaviors in the real world dr paul graham an expert on insect navigation at the university of sussex in england who was not involved in this new research told national geographic its really beautiful when you get a proper behaviorespecially something fun like a beetle rolling dung balls for the research the scientists gave nocturnal and nonnocturnal dung beetles their own balls of poop when the dung beetles began rolling the balls the scientists manipulated the sunlight using mirrors to make the dung beetles think the sun had moved locations they found that both types of dung beetle were fooled and adjusted their course of movement but when the scientists used the mirrors to manipulate the location of the moonlight they behaved differently the nonnocturnal dung beetles were still fooled but the nocturnal ones werent and didnt change their path the scientists discovered this is because their internal navigation system doesnt react to the location of the moon but the light itself called polarized light or scattered light thats generated by moonlight or light from the milky way national geographic reported humans cannot see polarized lightwaves but insects and other animals like bats can detect them we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again the researchers concluded that while the sun or moon dominates the navigation of nonnocturnal dung beetles the neurons in the brains of nocturnal dung beetles are designed to tune into polarized light at night the findings help to explain why even on a moonless night nocturnal dung beetles can navigate tough terrain
worldnews canberra australia ap solomon islands prime minister manasseh sogavare on friday blamed foreign interference over his governments decision to switch alliances from taiwan to beijing for antigovernment protests arson and looting that have ravaged the capital honiara in recent days but critics also blamed the unrest on complaints of a lack of government services and accountability corruption and chinese businesses giving jobs to foreigners instead of locals honiaras chinatown and its downtown precinct have been focuses of rioters looters and protesters who have demanded sogavare who has intermittently been prime minister since 2000 to resign the national parliament building a police station and businesses have been set alight during two tumultuous days in which police failed to control the mob sogavare angered many in 2019 particularly leaders of the solomon islands most populous province malaita when he cut the countrys diplomatic ties with taiwan malaita leaders complain their island has been unfairly deprived of government investment since the change a plane carrying australian police and diplomats arrived late thursday in honiara where they will help local police efforts to restore order australias defense minister peter dutton said sogavare said he stood by his governments decision to embrace beijing which he described as the only issue in the violence which was unfortunately influenced and encouraged by other powers external pressures were a very big influence i dont want to name names well leave it there sogavare said im not going to bow down to anyone we are intact the governments intact and were going to defend democracy he added australian foreign minister marise payne did not agree that other countries had stirred up the unrest we have not indicated that at all payne said weve been very clear our view is we dont want to see violence we would very much hope for a return to stability she added local journalist gina kekea said the foreign policy switch to beijing with little public consultation was one of a mix of issues that led to the protests there were also complaints that foreign companies were not providing local jobs chinese businesses and other asian businesses seem to have most of the work especially when it comes to extracting resources which people feel strongly about kekea said protesters had been replaced by looters and scavengers on friday in chinatown kekea said its been two days two whole days of looting and protesting and rioting and honiara is just a small city kekea said of the home to 85000 people so i think that theres nothing much left for them to loot and spoil now she added australian prime minister scott morrison on thursday committed troops police and diplomats to help local police restore order and protect critical infrastructure australia would not assist in the protection of the national parliament and the executive buildings in a sign that australia was not taking political sides some observers argue australia intervened quickly to avoid chinese security forces moving in to restore order but morrison said sogavare had asked for help because he trusted australia the solomon islands reached out to us first as family because they trust us and weve worked hard for that trust in the pacific morrison said that is our region and were standing up to secure our region with our partners our friends our family and allies he added sogavare requested assistance from australia under a bilateral security treaty that has existed since 2017 when australian peacekeepers last left the solomon islands australia led an international police and military force called the regional assistance mission to solomon islands that restored peace in the country after bloody ethnic violence from 2003 until 2017 morrison questioned whether chinese citizens and businesses were being targeted he described the unrest as a bit of a mixed story and noted chinatown was the scene of rioting before australias 2003 intervention china meanwhile expressed serious concern about recent attacks on some chinese citizens and institutions without providing details we believe that under the leadership of prime minister sogavare the solomon islands government can restore social order and stability as soon as possible chinese foreign ministry spokesperson zhao lijian said on thursday he said that economic and other cooperation since the establishment of diplomatic relations has benefited both sides any attempts to undermine the normal development of chinasolomon relations are futile he said dutton said a plane carrying 23 federal police officers and several diplomats flew from the australian capital canberra to honiara late thursday up to 50 more police as well 43 defense force personnel with a navy patrol boat were scheduled to arrive on friday the australian force would also be equipped to provide a medical response dutton said its certainly a dangerous situation on the ground weve seen the rioting thats taken place the arson and the general disorder thats there at the moment as well dutton said so theres a lot of work for the police to do on the ground he added sogavare declared a lockdown wednesday after about 1000 people gathered in protest in honiara demanding his resignation over a host of domestic issues the protesters breached the national parliament building and burned the thatched roof of a nearby building the government said they also set fire to a police station and other buildings sogavare ordered the capital locked down from 7 pm wednesday through 7 pm friday after saying he had witnessed another sad and unfortunate event aimed at bringing a democratically elected government down despite an announcement from the solomon islands police force that they would be conducting increased patrols through honiara amid the lockdown protesters again took to the streets thursday local media reported that many of the protesters were from malaita whose premier daniel suidani has been at odds with sogavare whom he accuses of being too close to beijing suidani said he was not responsible for the violence in honiara but told the solomon star news that he agreed with the calls for sogavare to resign the solomon islands about 1500 kilometers 1000 miles northeast of australia were the scene of bloody fighting during world war ii after it was captured by the japanese us marines landed on the island of guadalcanal in august 1942 to open a campaign to wrest back control they were successful though fighting in and

politics the head of nations top public health agency on wednesday announced a shakeup of the organization intended to make it more nimble the planned changes at the centers for disease control and prevention cdc leaders call it a reset come amid ongoing criticism of the agencys response to covid19 monkeypox and other public health threats the changes include internal staffing moves and steps to speed up data releases the cdcs director dr rochelle walensky told the agencys staff about the changes on wednesday its a cdc initiative and was not directed by the white house or other administration officials she said i feel like its my my responsibility to lead this agency to a better place after a really challenging three years walensky told the associated press the cdc with a 12 billion budget and more than 11000 employees is an atlantabased federal agency charged with protecting americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats its customary for each cdc director to do some reorganizing but walenskys action comes amid a wider demand for change the agency has long been criticized as too ponderous focusing on collection and analysis of data but not acting quickly against new health threats but public unhappiness with the agency grew dramatically during the covid19 pandemic experts said the cdc was slow to recognize how much virus was entering the us from europe to recommend people wear masks to say the virus can spread through the air and to ramp up systematic testing for new variants we saw during covid that cdcs structures frankly werent designed to take in information digest it and disseminate it to the public at the speed necessary said jason schwartz a health policy researcher at the yale school of public health walensky who became director in january 2021 has long said the agency has to move faster and communicate better but stumbles have continued during her tenure in april she called for an indepth review of the agency which resulted in the announced changes her reorganization proposal must be approved by the department of health and human services secretary cdc officials say they hope to have a full package of changes finalized approved and underway by early next year some changes still are being formulated but steps announced wednesday include increasing use of preprint scientific reports to get out actionable data instead of waiting for research to go through peer review and publication by the cdc journal morbidity and mortality weekly report restructuring the agencys communications office and further revamping cdc websites to make the agencys guidance for the public more clear and easier to find altering the length of time agency leaders are devoted to outbreak responses to a minimum of six months an effort to address a turnover problem that at times caused knowledge gaps and affected the agencys communications creation of a new executive council to help walensky set strategy and priorities appointing mary wakefield as senior counselor to implement the changes wakefield headed the health resources and services administration during the obama administration and also served as the no 2 administrator at hhs wakefield 68 started monday altering the agencys organization chart to undo some changes made during the trump administration establishing an office of intergovernmental affairs to smooth partnerships with other agencies as well as a higherlevel office on health equity walensky also said she intends to get rid of some of the reporting layers that exist and id like to work to break down some of the silos she did not say exactly what that may entail but emphasized that the overall changes are less about redrawing the organization chart than rethinking how the cdc does business and motivates staff this will not be simply moving boxes on the organization chart she said schwartz said flaws in the federal response go beyond the cdc because the white house and other agencies were

environment the ocean is enormous supporting a vast array of life while providing food fuel recreation and spiritual rejuvenation but efforts to conserve the ocean though valiant are meager compared to the scale of the threats to the ocean ocean conservation advocates have achieved many notable successes such as dramatic reductions in certain kinds of pollution the establishment of marine protected areas mpas and major improvements in fishery management in some areas of the world however a recent analysis that the environmental defense fund edf participated in suggests that 40 percent of the ocean is still strongly impacted by a range of threats including shipping the modification of rivers and estuaries coastal development pollution and overfishing how can we scale conservation efforts up to match the oceans vastness and the severity of these threats to answer this question we must first accurately diagnose the problem conventional markets which drive so much of mass human behavior only value a few of the many goods and services that the ocean provides like fish and oil the critically important ocean processes that produce fish regulate the climate assimilate wastes and provide all of the other goods and services on which the diversity of ocean life and we humans depend are generally not valued by markets because markets see value only in parts of the ocean and not in the whole the valuable pieces are extracted and the rest is degraded conservation has been pushing back against market forces among the most powerful forces in the world in the form of regulation while regulations like water quality standards and mpas can be very effective they often depend on high levels of enforcement because they are working against market forces and the incentives to exploit valuable resources without stewarding the ecosystems that support them regulations in this context are often perceived as threats to livelihood and human welfare resulting in opposition and conflict it is not surprising that it typically takes many years and sometimes decades to get ocean conservation measures in place we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased

uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again conservation has been like playing soccer uphill no matter how skillfully and energetically we kick the ball it keeps rolling back forcing us to scramble continuously to keep it up field and in much of the world the field is very steep the pressure to overexploit ocean resources is particularly strong because few alternative sources of livelihood food fiber and other resources are available to scale up ocean conservation we need to level the playing field so the ball rolls into the conservation goal this means ensuring markets work for conservation instead of against it in our new paper just published in biological reviews my coauthors and i evaluate the increasing number of tools that are available for doing just that catch shares have helped fisheries meet their conservation goals while increasing profits payments for ecosystem services are resulting in improved coastal watershed conservation mitigation banking has helped restore mangrove forests salt marshes and oyster reefs water quality markets cap and trade programs have helped farmers reduce polluted runoff and new markets that value other ecosystem services such as the amazingly efficient carbon storage capacity of mangrove forests and even the recreational value of coral reefs are rapidly emerging we term this collection of tools ecomarkets marketbased ocean conservation is no panacea governments must still create and enforce the rules and constraints that any market needs to avoid bad outcomes moreover many serious challenges remain these marketbased conservation tools must be very carefully designed and implemented to be effective new kinds of secure privileges must be created that allow coastal stewards to benefit from their own conservation efforts must be created and these privileges need to extend over whole areas not just pieces of the ecosystem new social contracts must be forged to hold the beneficiaries of these privileges accountable to their stewardship responsibilities strenuous efforts to overcome these challenges are justified though because the new economies that result will value the ocean empower its stewards and create the potential for ocean conservation to become as large as the ocean itself

worldnews president trump has hinted at the possibility of military action against north korea but any us strike is likely to rapidly escalate into an allout war a fullscale conflict with north korea would cause mass casualties even in the bestcase scenario a usnorth korean war could lead to millions of deaths a refugee crisis and longterm instability president donald trumps taunt this week that his nuclear button was bigger and more powerful than north korean leader kim jong uns once again raised the specter of armed conflict between the us and kims regime trump has been engaged in an intense and at times juvenile battle of insults and threats with kim since he took office in that same time pyongyang has rapidly expanded its nuclear and missile capabilities amid the constantly escalating rhetoric between trump and north korea its easy to lose sight of what exactly is being threatened and just how devastating war with the country would be its a conflict that would undoubtedly kill thousands if not millions of people and likely bring about the first use of nuclear weapons in combat since world war ii analysts have looked at a number of possible scenarios for how a war between the us and north korea would play out most likely hostilities would start small but quickly become difficult to rein in for example north korea could retaliate after the us shoots down a missile test or because of some kind of misunderstanding around a perceived american military move experts say that if the us were to launch an initial strike say targeting a north korean missile site pyongyang could easily interpret it as the start of something larger more likely a limited strike would not stay limited and would quickly escalate everything ive read about north korean military doctrine and way of thinking indicates they would fight back fiercely and would regard even a socalled limited strike as the first salvo of the invasion that theyve been predicting for years said mark fitzpatrick head of the international institute for strategic studies nonproliferation and nuclear policy programme north korean defectors including a former diplomat have echoed that assessment warning that if the us were to conduct any sort of limited strike pyongyang would likely respond harshly to deter a fullon invasion from the us and its allies among north koreas immediate targets would be us bases in south korea and japan experts say which pyongyang would likely attempt to destroy using nuclear weapons as a show of force to deter further invasion the problem with the north korean strategy experts say is that rather than cause the us and its allies to back off from a conflict the use of nuclear weapons by pyongyang would motivate the us and its allies to launch an intense fullscale attempt to destroy north koreas military and decapitate its leadership its unlikely that the us would succeed in completely obliterating pyongyangs nuclear arsenal or its conventional weapons before north korea could target south korea with its artillery and devastate major metropolises like seoul and tokyo north korea could also potentially launch intercontinental ballistic missiles against the us mainland either in an immediate strike or after threatening cities like new york and washington with a strike to prevent further american military action analysts current assessments of north koreas missile and nuclear capability is that the country could reach most of the mainland united states with its intercontinental ballistic missiles and potentially be able to target major american cities although there is debate among missile experts over how accurately north korea could deliver a nuclear warhead to the us and whether such a weapon would survive reentry into the earths atmosphere the north korean military has shown itself to be increasingly proficient at conducting successful tests and is continually advancing its missile technology its possible that pyongyang could already hit cities like new york washington and los angeles with nuclear weapons it would take about 30 to 40 minutes from launch for north korean missiles to reach their targets in the us in the case of a nuclear attack the missiles would leave cities in rubble and kill thousands in the initial blasts but as in the cases of the japanese cities of hiroshima and nagasaki the deadly effects would not stop there its so horrible that people dont really ever want to deal with what it would really look like we pretend that theres a flash and everyones dead but thats not what happens said jeffrey lewis a nuclear policy expert at middlebury institute of international studies at monterey there would be survivors for days trying to make their way out of the rubble and back home dying of radiation poisoning he said to try and defend against missile attacks the us has spent decades investing billions into developing and testing missile defense systems that could knock missiles out of the sky before they reach populated areas but missile defense is an extremely difficult endeavor that experts liken to hitting a bullet with a bullet and tests so far have proven its not guaranteed to work people think it ought to work because it exists and we spent tens of billions of dollars on it but it hasnt been shown to be reliable or to work in realworld conditions said laura grego a senior scientist at the global security program at the union of concerned scientists i would not count on it being a good defense thats not the way you should think about it she added the us missile defense agency has around a 56 percent success rate in its tests since 1999 which means that if north korea were to launch multiple missiles the chances of at least a few warheads making it to their targets is extremely high this data goes against trumps statements on missile defense in october when he claimed that the us can shoot down missiles 97 percent of the time prompting missile experts to worry about washingtons overconfidence in the defense systems im worried about missile defenses role since an misapprehension or overestimation of its capabilities can be dangerous grego said although much of the focus in a hypothetical conflict with north korea concerns the role of missile strikes the country also has over a million troops at the ready to fight on the ground their military is the fourthlargest in the world and is supported by a paramilitary that is 4 to 5 million strong theres no doubt that north korea would put up a fierce fight in the event of a war said fitzpatrick although experts say that the us has the overwhelming military power to win a conflict with north korea they note a likelihood of continuous guerrilla warfare in the aftermath and the need for a massive occupation force to prevent the nations collapse into anarchy a population of more than 25 million people would need food and aid while also transitioning from a totalitarian political system that has closed it off from the world for decades china is also concerned that the fall of pyongyang would create a massive number of refugees crossing the border military forces and arms could also join the exodus and present a major crisis for the government if north koreas regime fell there would also be an urgent proliferation crisis and a race to prevent its extensive conventional chemical and nuclear weapons stocks from falling into the wrong hands altogether containing the fallout would be a military and political endeavor rarely seen in history likely costing trillions of dollars and killing untold numbers of people as tensions between the us and north korea continue to escalate trumps inflammatory statements and washingtons talk of a military option against north korea have brought increased uncertainty and concern about the risk of war but theres also a broader shift in the us relationship with north korea as american policy adapts to the growing and unpleasant reality that kims regime has the power to target the us this moment is so fraught because the north koreans are doing something very unusual the north koreans are transitioning from being like any other country which is vulnerable to american military coercion into a mutual deterrence relationship lewis said we really only have one historical data point and thats the soviet union in the late 1950s and early 1960s where we transitioned into a mutual deterrence relationship we didnt like it and we had the cuban missile crisis the north koreans are now making that same transition and were having a crisis about it can anyone prevent trump from launching a nuclear strike not really dotard vs rocketman the nuclear standoff that rattled 2017

environment john boehner its fair to say have never been a major player in california water policy or even in its hyperpolitical expression californias water wars hes served on the house agriculture committee and boasts of the agricultural richness of his ohio congressional district but he was perfectly willing at the end of 2013 to let the house go home without passing the farm bill the speaker was adamant that the house would not stay in session past dec 13 to finish work on the legislation ive made it clear that the house is going to leave next friday boehner said you all know me pretty well i say what i mean and i mean what i say and theres nothing on his congressional website to indicate a profound interest in the welfare of the san joaquin delta so it might have seemed perplexing that he suddenly popped up in bakersfield a few weeks ago to announce his personal support for legislation to reignite californias water wars by declaring that in a looming drought catastrophe whether you got water ought to depend on whom your district voted for boehner didnt say as much and he might not even admit it but the bill he endorsed basically says that californians who need water to manufacture computers entice tourists provide apartment dwellers with showers catch salmon or grow high value crops like asparagus should get much less in a crisis and californians who grow cotton or alfalfa and live in heavily republican congressional districts should be bailed out california is suffering october in january the standard greeting this month when you meet a friend is do you like

lost in his first tenure in sacramento to resolve the gnarly problem of how to best transport water through the sacramentosan joaquin delta for delivery further south browns solution tunnels are expensive and unpopular just like his 1970s foray the peripheral canal the governors new proposal fails to recognize that california has a water allocation and a water waste problem that must be solved before it can rationally plan water distribution there is no agreement on how much water his tunnels should carry or where it should end up which makes it impossible to achieve consensus on how they should be designed or operated the drought could give him a chance to be bolder and potentially more successful one of the things you look for in a drought is a way to bring people together to share and overcome the reality that there is not enough water for anyones historic expectations thats what makes farmer johns boehners intervention now embodied in house legislation so unhelpful boehners speech had not a single word of concern for californias fishing communities or for the vegetable growers of the delta the electronics manufacturers in silicon valley the ski operators of the sierra nevada or the cattlemen of the northern coastal valleys by overpromising deliveries to water wasting agriculture boehners proposal even threatens the remaining republican suburban base in southern california with more severe rationing boehner has no doubt been told this but he chose to inject himself in bakersfield like a city slicker in fancy shoes crossing a cow pasture heres a reason that makes logic of this if a peculiar dc style of logic boehner intends to be more cooperative in resolving issues like the debt ceiling and the farm bill than tea party members of his caucus like rural representatives like devin nunes are his potential allies in this fight boehner knows that his allthewaterforcotton bill is not going to end up on the presidents desk its a message not a serious legislative ploy efforts by california republicans to insert their provisions into the farm bill were rebuffed even in the house so without really doing anything he can show hes a hard liner on an issue that rural californians in his caucus care intensely about as congressman george miller who has led the northern california team at water negotiating tables for decades commented boehners proposal has little or nothing to do with water policy in the state and everything to do with the politics of the republican caucus miller is retiring miller fears that the effort will pull the pin on the grenade and make it impossible for the state to come together to deal with both the immediate drought and the longer term water challenge lets hope that boehner merely messes up his don draper pants and shoes with the classic risk from venturing into unknown pastures the cow flop a veteran leader in the environmental movement carl pope spent the last 18 years of his career at the sierra club as ceo and chairman hes now the principal advisor at inside straight strategies looking for the underlying economics that link sustainability and economic development mr pope is coauthor along

technology san francisco march 21 reuters andy grove the silicon valley elder statesman who made intel into the worlds top chipmaker and helped usher in the personal computer age died on tuesday at age 79 intel said the company did not describe the circumstances of his death but grove who endured the nazi occupation of hungary during world war two living under a fake name and came to the united states to escape the chaos of soviet rule had suffered from parkinsons grove was intels first hire after it was founded in 1968 and became the practicalminded member of a triumvirate that eventually led intel inside processors to be used in more than 80 percent of the worlds personal computers with his motto only the paranoid survive which became the title of his bestselling management book grove championed an innovative environment within intel that became a blueprint for successful california startups grove who was named man of the year by time magazine in 1997 encouraged disagreement and insisted employees be vigilant of disruptions in industry and technology that could be major dangers or opportunities for intel in doing so he could be mercurial and demanding with employees who he thought were not doing enough and in 1981 required the staff to work two extra hours a day with no extra pay groves overhaul of intels business switching from digital memory to processors was an early example of his obsession with detecting major shifts in business and technology and staying flexible enough to move quickly and make the most of them its not that you shouldnt plan but you should not regard your plans to be anything more than a baseline model of what might happen grove said while intel founders robert noyce and gordon moore proposed much of the chip technology that helped created the semiconductor industry grove was the stickler for detail who turned their ideas into actual products he was responsible for driving growth in intels profits and stock price through the 1980s and 1990s grove who was jewish was born andras grof in budapest in 1936 nazi germany occupied hungary in his youth and after the soviets followed grove sneaked into austria in 1956 and then emigrated to the united states where he learned english and earned a phd in chemical engineering from the university of california at berkeley grove went to work in 1963 at fairchild semiconductor where he researched technology that would eventually be used to make microchips at fairchild he also met chip visionaries noyce and moore who left to found intel in 1968 grove quickly joined them running research and manufacturing he became intels president in 1979 ceo in 1987 and chairman and ceo in 1997 he gave up his ceo title in 1998 and stayed on as chairman until 2004 in its early years intel focused on making dram memory chips when japanese competition soared grove made the fateful decision to reinvent intel as a manufacturer of microprocessors the brains at the center of personal computers and other electronic devices as the personal computer industry took off in the 1980s intel supplied its processors to ibm and then to compaq and other manufacturers making ibm clone pcs intels chips along with microsofts windows operating system quickly became an industry standard in the exploding pc industry with grove funneling profits into research and development to create faster and faster processors under his stewardship the pentium brand and intel inside logo became widely recognized by consumers intel remains one of the worlds leading semiconductor companies but the pc chipmaker is wrestling to adapt to trends toward smaller gadgets like smartphones and tablets grove also was a champion of keeping manufacturing within the united states arguing outsourcing the manufacturing of electronics products like batteries or televisions meant us companies missed out on gaining experience necessary to make technology breakthroughs intel still makes most of its chips in us plants during his time at intel in the 1990s grove was treated for prostate cancer and later wrote an influential cover story in fortune magazine criticizing the medical establishments treatment of the disease as inefficient compared to scientific standards applied in semiconductor research in later life grove donated tens of millions of dollars for research on parkinsons disease a condition he suffered from he also regularly criticized government and medical researchers for making slow and inefficient progress beating that disease compared to accomplishments made in the chip industry grove and his wife eva who married a year after meeting while working at a resort in new hampshire in 1957 had two daughters reporting by noel randewich editing by bill trott peter henderson and bernard orr
politics president joe biden is set to channel john f kennedy on the 60th anniversary of jfks moonshot speech highlighting biden administration efforts aimed at ending cancer as we know it the president was traveling to boston on monday to draw attention to a new federally backed study that seeks to validate using blood tests to screen against multiple cancers a potential gamechanger in diagnostic testing to dramatically improve early detection of cancers he also planned other announcements meant to better the lives of those suffering from cancer his speech at the john f kennedy presidential library and museum comes as biden seeks to rally the nation around developing treatments and therapeutics for the pervasive diseases that the centers for disease control and prevention rank as the secondhighest killer of people in the us after heart disease biden hopes to move the us closer to the goal he set in february of cutting us cancer fatalities by 50 over the next 25 years and to dramatically improve the lives of caregivers and those suffering from cancer danielle carnival the white house cancer moonshot coordinator told the associated press that the administration sees huge potential in the commencement of the blood diagnostic study on identifying and treating cancers one of the most promising technologies has been the development of blood tests that offer the promise of detecting multiple cancers in a single blood test and really imagining the impact that could have on our ability to detect cancer early and in a more equitable way carnival said we think the best way to get us to the place where those are realized is to really test out the technologies we have today and see what works and what really has an impact on extending lives in 2022 the american cancer society estimates 19 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed and 609360 people will die of cancer diseases the issue is personal to biden who lost his adult son beau in 2015 to brain cancer after beaus death congress passed the 21st century cures act which dedicated 18 billion over seven years for cancer research and was signed into law in 2016 by president barack obama obama designated biden then vice president to run mission control on directing the cancer funds as a recognition of bidens grief as a parent and desire to do something about it biden wrote in his memoir promise me dad that he chose not to run for president in 2016 primarily because of beaus death despite bidens attempts to hark back to kennedy and his space program the current initiative lacks that same level of budgetary support the apollo program garnered massive public investment more than 20 billion or more than 220 billion in 2022 dollars adjusted for inflation bidens moonshot effort is far more modest and reliant on private sector investment still biden has tried to maintain momentum for investments in public health research including championing the advanced research projects agency for health modeled after similar research and development initiatives benefiting the pentagon and intelligence community on monday biden will announce dr renee wegrzyn as the inaugural director of arpah which has been given the task of studying treatments and potential cures for cancers alzheimers diabetes and other diseases he will also announce a new national cancer institute scholars program to provide resources to earlycareer scientists studying treatments and cures for cancer in boston biden will also attend an event at logan international airport to highlight investments from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law as well as a fundraiser for the democratic national committee experts agree its far too early to say whether these new blood tests for finding cancer in healthy people will have any effect on cancer deaths there have been no studies to show they reduce the risk of dying from cancer still they say setting an ambitious goal is important carnival said the national cancer institute study was designed so that any promising diagnostic results could be swiftly put into widespread practice while the longerterm study expected to last up to a decade progresses she said the goal was to move closer to a future where cancers could be detected through routine bloodwork potentially reducing the need for more invasive and burdensome procedures like colonoscopies and therefore saving lives scientists now understand that cancer is not a single disease but hundreds of diseases that respond differently to different treatments some cancers have biomarkers that can be targeted by existing drugs that will slow a tumors growth many more targets await discovery how do we learn what therapies are effective in which subtypes of disease that to me is oceanic said donald a berry a biostatistician at the university of texas md anderson cancer center the possibilities are enormous the challenges are enormous despite the challenges hes optimistic about cutting the cancer death rate in half over the next 25 years we can get to that 50 goal by slowing the disease sufficiently across the various cancers without curing anybody berry said if i were to bet on whether we will achieve this 50 reduction i would bet yes even without new breakthroughs progress can be made by making care more equitable said dr crystal denlinger chief scientific officer for the national comprehensive cancer network a group of elite cancer centers and any effort to reduce the cancer death rate will need to focus on the biggest cancer killer which is lung cancer mostly attributable to smoking lung cancer now causes more cancer deaths than any other cancer of the 1670 daily cancer deaths in the united states more than 350 are from lung cancer lung cancer screening is helping the american cancer society says such screening helped drive down the cancer death rate 32 from its peak in 1991 to 2019 the most recent year for which numbers are available but only 5 of eligible patients are being screened for lung cancer its tragic said dr roy herbst a lung specialist at yale cancer center the moonshot is going to have to be a social fix as well as a scientific and medical fix herbst said were going to have to find a way that screening becomes easier that its fully covered that we have more screening facilities biden planned to urge americans who might have delayed cancer screenings during the pandemic to seek them out swiftly reminding them that early detection can be key to avoiding adverse outcomes he was also set to highlight provisions in the democrats healthcare and climate change bill that the administration believes will lower out of pocket drug prices for some widely used cancer treatments he will also celebrate new guarantees for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits that cover their potential cancer diagnoses dr michael hassett of danafarber cancer institute in boston said bidens goal to reduce cancer deaths could met by following two parallel paths one of discovery and the other making sure as many people as possible are reaping the advantages of existing therapies and preventive approaches if we can address both aspects both challenges major advances are possible hassett said in breast cancer for example many women who could benefit from a hormoneblocking pill either never start the therapy or stop taking it before the recommended five years hassetts research has found those are big gaps hassett said thats a treatment thats effective but if many people arent taking that medication or if theyre taking it but stopping it before concluding the course of therapy then the benefits that the medicine could offer arent realized we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism

science some scientists like to think of themselves as modern counterparts of prometheus the greek god who brought the creative power of fire to humankind privately they may express surprise that an activity research in which they take so much satisfaction can at least potentially attract public or private funds but the fact that this occurs and is indeed routine only confirms their selfimage as foremost among societys heroes much rarer is for scientists to question why this money flows to their enterprise or how science and technology has helped those governmental and commercial institutions with such resources to dispense increase their leverage over everyone else there are other academics frequently in quasiscientific fields who take it on themselves to publicly congratulate scientists for all the good that they do how dare anyone presuming to speak on behalf of the public even suggest putting precautionary or ethical obstacles in the way of scientific research and its commercial implementation they ask get out of the way barks steven pinker a harvard psychologist in a recent boston globe oped piece while addressing himself to professional bioethicists a notoriously meek lot when it comes to recommendations that would alter the course of technological developments in any meaningful way pinkers broader target is a purported prodisease and prodeath lobby which he claims to be concerned about such things as warehouses of zombies to supply people with spare organs pinkers disingenuous rhetoric notwithstanding after mammalian cloning was shown to be feasible in the late 1990s there was in fact active discussion of producing genetically replicate humans usually conceived as lacking a conscious brain to provide replacement organs pinker decries perverse analogies withnazi atrocities assuring his readers that we already have ample safeguards for the safety and informed consent of patients and research subjects he might have benefited from looking into the origins at the nazi war crime trials of the nuremberg code the basis of these ample safeguards and the opposition to them while they were being drafted by the american medical association using professionalist arguments much like his own he might also have considered the evidence that the code is routinely ignored pinker mocks those skeptical of using the new crisprcas9 gene modification methods for editing genomes presumably including those of humans since his oped concerns human health he supports his call to leave to the experts all decisions as to when or if to genetically engineer humans by invoking increased lifespan and decline of disease in prosperous countries as if these were attributable to biotechnology rather than improved nutrition and sanitation genuine advances in medicine due to molecular biology such as treatments for heart disease and therapies for certain cancers were arrived at by trialanderror on volunteers chosen among desperately ill existing people with few alternatives they were not intended as techniques for irreversible experimental refashioning of prospective people as germline modification would be nonspecialists may not have the nuanced technical understanding of the crisprcas9 system that pinker seems to believe qualifies one to make these decisions though apparently technical expertise is not needed in order to cheer the scientists on anyone who follows the news however can read about the brewing industrial battles over patents for gene drive technologies that would permit a companys preferred genes to displace natural variants or those of competitors they might also acquire an alternative perspective on the moral and social compass of some experts by following the stories of computer scientists aiding the government in the collection of massive amounts of personal data on ordinary citizens or the design and participation in cia torture programs by pinkers fellow members of the american psychological association clearly not all experts or genetics researchers are inclined to take the low road by participating in such ethically unacceptable activities the sad reality however is that the grip on technology by commercial and governmental centers of power ensures that scientists whether manhattan project researchers some of whom hoped that the atomic bomb be used in a demonstration not on population centers or wellintentioned developers of antibiotics who have seen their efforts to alleviate disease turn into their opposite do not control the fruits of their research notwithstanding the credulousness of certain aficionados of science this article first appeared in biopolitical times center for genetics and society

health you say you want it now the question is do you feel worthy whether it is a loving relationship or the house of your dreams we can only attract and manifest what we believe we deserve relationships are like mirrors they reflect back to us aspects of ourselves when our partner has good qualities we sometimes put them on a pedestal of admiration thinking wow they are so generous or smart or beautiful when a person has worthiness issues they cannot see how these positive traits exist inside themselves as well while they may be hidden deep inside them and not often expressed they too are generous and smart and beautiful if they would only do the work to discover it what is a worthiness issue for the purpose of this discussion it is when a person either consciously or unconsciously feels they are not deserving of love understanding ease financial abundance good health or any other of the many beneficial gifts that are available to us by virtue of being born i believe in a creative source that loves us wants the best for us sees the best in us and offers all that we could ever wish to be do and have in this life a quote by indian poet rabindranath tagor says it perfectly everything comes to us that belongs to us if we have the capacity to receive it how do our feelings of worthiness impact our relationships since we can only receive what we have room for in our consciousness if what we want and what we are capable of taking in are out of balance we will continue to experience frustration and disappointment on some level of our lives for example if one persons internal storage space to receive love is the size of tea cup and they have a partner whose love for them is as vast as the ocean they will never experience the fullness of all the love their partner shares with them when their little tea cup is filled all the rest of that love will just spill over and they will miss out on most of the gifts of love that are being offered such a person may cry out to their partner but you dont love me and they will be convinced of the rightness of their position yet what is really going on as the example just illustrated is not at all about their partners love for them but about their ability to receive it as a wonderful therapist friend of mine once said sometimes you have to grow new eyes to be able to see the truth of the matter therefore if the issue is operating on an unconscious level it will have to be brought to conscious awareness before it can be effectively dealt with i believe we can only change what we are aware of and we will only change what we recognize as necessary and valuable the first cousins to feelings of unworthiness are martyrdom and blame martyrs habitually overextend themselves to compensate for feelings of unworthiness they feel they must do it all and be it all to earn the love and approval of others even if it means compromising their physical mental emotional or financial wellbeing then when they are exhausted and depleted from all of this extraordinary and illplaced effort they blame others with a woe is me look at all ive done for you and i get nothing in exchange or a no one cares about me as much as i care about them type of attitude as for blaming others for our unhappiness or disappointment there is an old saying when you point a finger at someone you have four more pointing at yourself if you find yourself blaming others i say that the four fingers are urging you to get to work they are asking you to take a good hard look at the hows and whys of your own behavior and to redirect the time and energy spent looking outside yourself at other peoples shortcomings to examine yourself and to become aware of your own ingrained habits and patterns so you can better understand how you have been unintentionally conspiring against your own happiness when a person is giving from a place of authentic generosity which is born of selflove rather than insecurity or guilt they feel filled with joy in their giving conversely giving to others as a bartering tool for love leaves us feeling like an overdrawn bank account and we find ourselves filled with resentment blame and other negative energy when we feel worthy we recognize our value and command on an energetic level that others know and acknowledge it too we dont have to beg and plead and convince others to see our worth instead we have an air of ease about us that comes from a clear understanding and deep knowing that we are deserving of what makes us happy people around us feel this and respond appropriately this is not to be confused with arrogance and misguided notions of entitlement which are often masks for feelings of unworthiness what are ways we can begin to address feelings of unworthiness here is what worked for me 1pay attention to yourself observe your thoughts and your feelings about your life in general if you discover or are aware of areas where you feel you are getting the short end of the stick so to speak and this dynamic is happening rather consistently in your life i say this is a good place to start the issue may be around love or money or being respected at home or work whatever the case recognize that the power to change it lies in your hands 2when you are ready to change seek out a qualified therapist or other practitioner that facilitates healing or wellbeing for their clients i prefer those who work with the mind body emotional and spiritual components of the issues at hand in particular i have had success with reiki an ancient eastern healing modality and regression therapy sometimes the roots of feelings of unworthiness are buried along with the memories of a past trauma 3on my journey to wellness i have also found eft emotional freedom technique to be surprisingly helpful in clearing out traumatic issues it is unconventional however i loved the fact that i could do it in the privacy of my home a google or youtube search will allow you to read about and watch video of the technique and judge for yourself if its something youd like to use 4as always i am a huge advocate of prayer and meditation for positive change of all kinds when approached with a sincere and reverent intention to establish peace or improve our wellbeing we have the ability to get in touch with aspects of ourselves that yield profoundly useful insights and information to better navigate our lives in this case silence is truly golden the bottom line is we are all born worthy as babies our instincts tell us we have the right to everything we need milk a clean diaper and the gifts of touch and love somewhere along the way depending on our circumstances some of us learn to believe otherwise what better time than now to realize see with our real eyes

health well here i go my job is ending and i need health insurance coverage with a preexisting condition type 1 diabetes my heart starts to race just thinking about this nightmare let me preface this post by saying that ive never as a health care consumer with a preexisting condition tried to obtain health care insurance coverage through obamacare and in full transparency let me state that i also have access to cobra which i plan to activate until i see how this whole experience goes in my mind i see this as a safety net for now and this fact may influence my experience a bit as i dont for now have that desperate angle to my experience all of us with a preexisting condition can relate right anyway cobra is very expensive but at least i can purchase coverage for the next 18 months if i have to i simply cannot have any lapse in coverage so for now cobra it is i know a lot about the logistics of the affordable care act and how its supposed to work but i have never actually needed to put it to task until now and i need this to work i have championed health coverage for preexisting conditions and feel that obamacare is the first step towards that goal and because my perspective is that im looking for this to work this might translate into a personal view that may be more tolerant andor lenient with regards to the entire process and as critical as the end result of being allowed to purchase health care coverage is i believe that its not just that end result that matters its the entire experience the human factor of this process so i look at it as a threepart process comprised of 3 actually using my new plan to be a proactive health care consumer in order to keep from getting sick and being a burden on my family friends and society i hold the very strong belief that if the process of signing up for access to insurance through obamacare isnt a good experience it will taint the overall perspective of obamacare in general remember any of us who have dealt with insurance companies with or without preexisting conditions know how frustrating and time consuming it is it can also be very frightening and very confusing lets see how obamacare compares i also know that not everyone will experience what i experience when going through this process just as when anyone calls any customer service representative all calls will vary from awful to wonderful some of it depends on the tone that is set by the company and its management team and a lot of it depends on the representative and the caller vs what kind of a day theyre both having right but this is my personal experience and i will report on it alone from my personal experience only remember im approaching this as a nave consumer so hold your opinion of what i should have said or done as this is my experience and my perspective the only agenda i hold is that i need this to work for my family and me i want this process to work and so i will immerse myself into the first process of finding out how it works for my situation and i will take you with me on this journey lets go
sports the overly complicated nfl rulebook has struck again this time on monday night in a game between the seattle seahawks and the detroit lions once again instead of talking about the game nfl fans are talking about the rules specifically the rules surrounding seahawks linebacker kj wrights decision to bat the ball out of the end zone after a calvin johnson fumble in the final two minutes of the fourth quarter here are two different views of the bat calvin johnson fumbles right before getting into the endzone pictwittercomduha1fcpc9 espn is saying that this was an illegal bat out of the endzone by the seahawks pictwittercomryu8bshjor according to the leagues rulebook wrights move was illegal rule 12 section 4 article 1 clearly states it is an illegal bat if any player bats or punches a loose ball that has touched the ground in any direction if it is in either end zone but the illegal bat went ignored by the referees and the seahawks went on to win the game 1310 people especially lions fans were understandably upset that the referee had not made the correct call but the larger issue is once again the leagues overly complex rules and the impossibility of all refs adequately understanding them no team has been screwed more by obscure nfl rules than the detroit lions this is unreal dear detroit lions we messed up and blew the call on another obscure rule were sorry enjoy being 04 the nfl havent seen an illegal bat since pictwittercomi6ciyxniin the main crux of this specific issue is that there are too many rules and apparently enough gray area in some of them to make sure problems like monday nights can and will occur again the nfl and their rules have become a reallife onion article this is just another example of how complex the interpretations of these rules have gotten where a catch may not actually be a catch or where a declined penalty within the last five minutes of a game will still stop the clock after the game wright admitted that he intentionally batted the ball out of bounds and that it looked that way but the official at the back of the end zone did not see it that way the back judge was on the play and in his judgment he didnt feel it was an overt act so he didnt throw the flag nfl head of officials dean blandino said we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again this time its possible that the rules were not only confusing to players coaches and fans but perhaps to the officials as well whether the back judge wants to say he didnt think it was an overt act or not it was clear to everybody watching that it was an intentional bat of the ball either the referee cant interpret the obvious or he didnt know the rule and when the nfl rulebook is too confusing for the people in charge of the games you know you have a problem whether the league wants to admit it or not
politics president joe biden on wednesday is set to announce his longdelayed move to forgive up to 10000 in federal student loans for many americans and extend a pause on payments to january according to three people familiar with the plan biden has faced pressure from liberals to provide broader relief to hardhit borrowers and from moderates and republicans questioning the fairness of any widespread forgiveness the delay in bidens decision has only heightened the anticipation for what his own aides acknowledge represents a political nowin situation the people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss bidens intended announcement ahead of time the precise details of bidens plan which will include an income cap limiting the forgiveness to only those earning less than 125000 a year were being kept to an unusually small circle within the biden administration and were still not finalized on the eve of the announcement downtothewire decisionmaking has been a hallmark of the biden white house but the particular delay on student loans reflects the vexing challenge confronting him in fulfilling a key campaign promise

environment energy savings is certainly on a lot of peoples minds as winter 2014 has kicked off in fearsome fashion across the united states yet savings know no season and are sometimes affected by a timeline of when energy investments will have paid for themselves unfortunately most products dont come with this information clearly stamped on the box but thats where we come in here we examine seven popular product categories to see how long it might take before you realize any returns on investments payback time is an important factor in determining your energy savings but it should not be the sole factor in determining which appliance to buy or home improvement investment to make sometimes we spend money just to upgrade our quality of life and certainly a brand new refrigerator or windows will accomplish that but these decisions also produce measurable savings that take the edge off the final bill even as they contribute to a better environment and real energy efficiency and if youre on the fence about spending for your home payback time is arguably the one variable that can act as a tiebreaker knowing youll see a real return in real time can provide yes real comfort in more ways than one
social the school of the future will embrace the idea that parents need to be reeducated starting in elementary school about the tools methodologies curriculum and pedagogy that teachers are using to educate their kids geoffrey canada passionate leadership great teachers engaged parents advancing technology and a profound focus on preparing each and every student for life in a globalized world these are surely some of the things dedicated educators contemplate when they think about creating the template for the great schools of tomorrow the gems world academy in chicago recently invited a group of talented educators and innovative leaders to share in a think tank about what the school of the future will be like i was unable to make the event in person but the participants allowed me to interview them afterwards it is my pleasure to welcome to the the global search for education the president and ceo of the harlem childrens zone geoffrey canada the founding president of the illinois mathematics and science academy stephanie pace marshall and the founder of gsv advisors deborah quazzo additionally i am delighted to share the perspectives of the president of gems education solutions america denise gallucci and geoff jones head of school gems world academy chicago the classroom of tomorrow must focus on the learner each child is unique in his or her development and gems education approaches the role of the teacher as one who facilitates student discovery one who bolsters differentiating experiences to promote personalized learning and one who creates schools of one denise gallucci stephanie what skills will the principal of tomorrows school require and in what ways are these skills different from what heshe has today stephanie pace marshall your question focuses on the leadership skills required for tomorrows school leaders but i want to add the elements of knowledge and habits of mind also required and alter the context of leadership from leading an educational enterprise that takes place in structures called schools to leading an educational enterprise that is more distributed and networked tomorrows educational leaders will be cartographers map makers and designers of multigenerational learning communities environments that are not exclusively place bound but are bound by shared meaning purpose and values providing leadership for dynamic learning networks is far more complex and requires the following attributes an integration of knowledge habits of mind and skills for amplifying capacities within individuals communities and larger systems some of the leadership qualities i believe are critical for future educational leaders are knowledge and deep understanding of system dynamics and complexity knowledge skills experiences and strategies in multiple disciplines digital information technology and social networking brain science how to ignite and nurture creativity innovation entrepreneurship an integrated thinker and doer able to blur boundaries and see things as connected a risk taker that is not afraid to fail understanding that if you cant fail you cant be creative a learning experience designer who knows how to create immersive learning experiences for children to fail safely open transparent accessible inclusive collaborative and empowering views leadership as stewardship agile at multiple altitudes gets things done at 10000 feet executes strategy at 30000 feet and sees possibilities at 50000 feet the new school leaders must first see themselves as designers of amplified individual and system capacity as catalysts and agents of transformative change that identifies and develops individual and collective potential they are possibility thinkers harbingers of hope and wise navigators the new school leaders must first see themselves as designers of amplified individual and system capacity as catalysts and agents of transformative change that identifies and develops individual and collective potential they are possibility thinkers harbingers of hope and wise navigators stephanie pace marshall geoffrey how will teaching change in the classroom of tomorrow versus the classroom we know today geoffrey canada i think that the schools of the future will spend an inordinate amount of time and a significant amount of resources recruiting great teachers today we are not attracting the best and the brightest teachers particularly in difficult communities in the future schools will compete fiercely for the best and most qualified the schools of the future will value technology but not in replacement of teachers technology will be an adjunct to teaching for example the best schools will ensure their weakest academic areas are strengthened by the use of technology they will bring remote learning into schools so that a teacher in boston could be teaching a calculus class in little rock in real time the expertise is just not there in some communities because they are rural or impoverished technology is also going to allow us to teach children when they are the most alert and most focused the science is clear that adolescents have a different circadian rhythm they go to bed late and they wake up late we will be able to have young people design their personal learning in a way that takes advantage of their peak performance time schools of the future will recognize this and allow children to selfregulate schools of the future will recognize the importance of having students work in teams they will allow young people to develop a set of skills that bring in different subject areas and different areas of expertise to create new ideas currently there are no rewards for working in teams and being a good team member schools of the future will teach children how to learn on their own the school of the future will allow the student to learn new things by themselves online where competence is demonstrated by the end product and not simply regurgitating a set of facts or equations we are still teaching kids as if they dont have the answers right at their fingertips the school of the future will understand that students can go into areas where they have never been taught and become experts simply by consuming the information online great schools will use tests as sources of data and mine that data carefully for one reason and one reason only not to determine if the child is an a a b or an f but to see where this child is struggling and what we can do as an educational facility to help this interactive process between student and teacher will have teachers focused on mastery for all students the school of the future needs to prepare students to have an appreciation for computer coding as just another language and as an extension of logic in addition critical thinkingsocratic learning and project basedpeer learning are key elements that help develop independent thinking and presentation skills deborah quazzo what will the role of parents in tomorrows school community be how do you see it being different from what parents do now geoffrey canada it is going to be essential that parents be educated alongside their children so much of schoolwork will be a result of both technology and knowledge that didnt exist when parents were in school the school of the future will embrace the idea that parents need to be reeducated starting in elementary school about the tools methodologies curriculum and pedagogy that teachers are using to educate their kids if you alienate the parent so that they dont know how to help their child instead of empowering them you are losing a valuable educational ally in the future teachers will allow parents to know beforehand what their kids will be learning typically the way schools function is that teachers teach something and parents find out via homework or a test what the kid is supposed to know more and more schools will be providing parents with online advice and strategies for preparing their children so if a child is going to be studying world history in december schools will be prepping parents in october or november about things they can be doing with their child to prepare them this keeps parents engaged it keeps them ahead of their children and allows them to be true partners with the school denise can you describe what student centric learning will mean in the classroom of tomorrow how will this have changed denise gallucci the classroom of tomorrow must focus on the learner each child is unique in his or her development and gems education approaches the role of the teacher as one who facilitates student discovery one who bolsters differentiating experiences to promote personalized learning and one who creates schools of one the teacher scaffolds information to reach children in a context thats appropriate to their level today we are not attracting the best and the brightest teachers particularly in difficult communities in the future schools will compete fiercely for the best and most qualified geoffrey canada what changes will the school of tomorrow have made to better prepare every child for the rapidly changing 21st century world denise gallucci with the advancement of technology we are on the verge of the second industrial revolution where the jobs of today will no longer be here tomorrow at the same time the wealth of information available to students at their fingertips will be astounding but figuring out how to harness this information and turning it in to teachable moments will be critical so we have to help students crack the code understanding how to harness information and think critically we have to spark their intellectual curiosity and prepare them to be inquirers we have to help them become problem solvers and individuals who can work productively as a team and we have to provide children with an appreciation and a fluency in all the new technology that surrounds them to prepare them for what their future holds deborah quazzo i think the school of the future needs to prepare students to have an appreciation for computer coding as just another language and as an extension of logic in addition critical thinkingsocratic learning and project basedpeer learning are key elements that help develop independent thinking and presentation skills core writing capabilities need to complement all of this its about fluency in new languages of technology being able to articulate verbally and in writing and working well in collaborative teams geoff can you describe the role you see for online learning in the classroom of tomorrow how will it differ from what we see now geoff jones technology has become an increasingly larger part of not only our daily lives but also in the classroom gems education uses online learning in the classroom by linking its network of schools in 16 countries across the globe our use of state of the art technology enables students to connect not only with the rich cultural institutions of chicago but also with their classmates across the globe in etoy dubai london singapore and elsewhere this provides students an international perspective that is unmatched

science modern researchers have puzzled for centuries over the striking stone construction known as stonehenge but now researchers have discovered new aspects of the site including a processional road that may eventually help unravel some of its mysteries there are many theories about why ancient peoples constructed the prehistoric megalithic monument which is estimated to have been built between 3000 and 1520 bc located outside salisbury england stonehenge is the focus of ongoing research projects coordinated by english heritage a cultural preservation agency one of those projects recently uncovered previously hidden sections of an ancient pathway that researchers believe led directly to the site from the avon river in the nearby town of amesbury known as the avenue the pathway is believed to have been built sometime between 2600 and 2200 bc according to english heritage over time parts of the road were obscured and a modern road called a344 was built across it reports livescience the new road has made it almost impossible for researchers to confirm the purpose of the avenue according to livescience in an effort to answer some of these questions researchers carefully began removing the paved a344 while the banks of the original path had long since eroded away archaeologists were excited to find traces of two parallel ditches that once ran on either side of the path these ditches connected segments of the avenue bisected by a344 and here we have it the missing piece in the jigsaw heather sebire properties curator and archaeologist at english heritage said in an interview with bbc history magazine it is very exciting to find a piece of physical evidence that officially makes the connection which we were hoping for while the purpose of the avenue is not exactly clear sebire told livescience she believes it was involved in ancient processions to and from the site we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again it was constructed in 2300 bc so is a later addition to the stone circle but people would have processed along it to the monument sebire told bbc magazine its quite a dramatic finding at least one researcher unaffiliated with english heritage believes the excavation could help confirm a theory that the avenue leading to stonehenge was built along the solstice axis as archaeologist mike parker pearson told national geographic this means that the direction of the avenue moving away from the monument points toward where the sun rises on the midsummer solstice the longest day of the year but if you turn the path leading back toward stonehenge points toward where the sun sets on the midwinter solstice the shortest day of the year
politics democrats pulled off a fairly brilliant bit of marketing recently rebranding their big domestic legislation build back better into the smaller inflation reduction act of 2022 the new name is easier to understand addresses voters driving economic worries and satisfied the needs of sen joe manchin dwva whose support was crucial the legislation is substantial its the biggest federal investment in fighting climate change ever and the biggest change in medicare since 2003 but when it comes to actually reducing inflation as its name promises budget experts say it leaves much to be desired with the house set to pass it friday and send it on to president joe biden for his signature the bill will be one of the democrats primary defenses on the campaign trail when theyre asked about what they did about rising prices but republicans have attacked the bill as actually doing little the country is running on joe biden and congressional democrats record it is a miserable record with a cruel economy and nothing theyre going to do can change that because this will not tamp down inflation rep kevin brady rtexas said monday on fox news bradys concern found a sympathetic ear in the unlikely form of senate budget committee chair bernie sanders ivt who was frustrated that democrats didnt go further in their social agenda and push more ambitious legislation during debate on the bill which he ultimately voted for sanders went so far as to deride it as the socalled inflation reduction act the republican national committee even tweeted out video of sanders remarks bernie sanders on the socalled inflation reduction act according to the cbo and other economic organizations that have studied this bill it will in fact have a minimal impact on inflation pictwittercomge9h2cjigg the penn wharton budget model a project of the university of pennsylvania that aims to give congressional budget officetype independent analyses of legislation kicked off the criticism of the inflation reduction act on july 29 it projected that the bill would actually boost inflation by 005 percentage point in 2024 and reduce it by 025 percentage point in the late 2020s these point estimates however are not statistically different than zero thereby indicating a very low level of confidence that the legislation will have any impact on inflation according to the projects analysis the nonpartisan cbo came to a similar conclusion in a preliminary analysis released aug 4 cbo director phillip swagel wrote in calendar year 2022 enacting the bill would have a negligible effect on inflation in cbos assessment and in 2023 inflation would probably be 01 percentage point lower or higher than if the law was unchanged the key swagel said would be how the bill would affect various economic factors that determine inflation including demand the supply of workers supply chain disruptions and the reaction by the federal reserve and though the head of the penn wharton budget model kent smetters and swagel both served in the george w bush administration and in swagels case also at the conservative american enterprise institute their analyses have been seen as middle of the road these point estimates however are not statistically different than zero thereby indicating a very low level of confidence that the legislation will have any impact on inflation marc goldwein senior vice president and senior policy director at the bipartisan committee for a responsible federal budget told huffpost in an email that the inflation effects are likely to be small however goldwein said a side deal to loosen permitting restrictions on energy projects such as pipelines and energy export facilities would also help cut inflation but still the effects are likely to be modest and smaller in the final version of the bill than the original one he said democrats say those projections are too pessimistic and dont give enough credit for the things the bill would do like bring down prices on prescription drugs for seniors i think that this gives us a chance to cut a lot of costs and thats part of inflation senate finance committee chair ron wyden dore told reporters when the bill was on the senate floor for example he said as sure as night follows day private insurers will want to negotiate prices with drugmakers after they see how much medicare will be able to save by doing so if youre on the board of a private company and you look at what medicare is doing that board member will say to the ceo you better go get me that medicare is doing it why cant i have it he said the changes in the bill as it made it through the legislative process likely also reduced its effectiveness in something else democrats have touted cutting the budget deficit the cbo initially scored the package as cutting more than 100 billion from the budget deficit over 10 years for perspective the last cbo baseline estimate projected 157 trillion in deficits over the next decade cbo later revised down its estimate of the bills effect to about 905 billion before the senate began its debating crfbs goldwein said the postsenate version probably saw its deficit reduction cut even more to somewhere around 70 billion on thursday though the cbo released a letter from swagel saying the changes made since the bills unveiling which would include a narrowing of the prescription drug negotiation provision and a swapping out of tax provisions to preserve the carried interest loophole meant they could not give it a final score for a few weeks we remain committed to

tax revenue the cbo says can be expected from stepped up enforcement which is prohibited from being in the formal score the effect on the deficit would be relatively small but goldwein said the bill was significant in how it had been pared back from a more expensive proposal last year with much more gimmicky payfors the inflation reduction act though not perfect moves in the direction of deficit reduction something that hasnt happened in a serious way since 2011 or 2013 relative to current policy he said

economy customers visiting the geek squad desk at best buy werent always the most polite recalls sarah tremblay who worked at two store locations in long island new york until recently they were often freaking out because their laptop or their phone wasnt working no one is coming there because theyre having their best day and they tend to take it out on you tremblay told huffpost recently that was expected but the sexual harassment the assault the stalking that was not ok she said in a lawsuit filed in new york state court thursday tremblay says she was repeatedly harassed by customers male customers groped her kissed her and even stalked her according to the complaint a male colleague also made lewd comments tremblay repeatedly complained to her store manager but he did nothing about her complaints she reported the harassment to human resources at best buy headquarters in richfield minnesota they suggested she file a police report and even take a leave of absence to deal with the anxiety that tremblay said she was experiencing yet shortly after that tremblay was fired in 2018 the ostensible reason was that she had not sent all her customers online surveys about their shopping experience she told her managers at the time that she only did this if a customer behaved poorly toward her tremblay was promoted several times over the years at best buy her pay rising from 1275 an hour to a little more than 20 by the time she left she was even included in a group of retail employees who were fasttracked for corporate roles in her lawsuit she says that she was let go in retaliation for complaining about mistreatment i was devastated she told huffpost best buys mistreatment was somehow worse than the harassment i felt hurt and betrayed i never imagined id be retaliated against best buy did not respond immediately to huffposts request for comment after the suit was filed on thursday tremblay age 34 had worked in retail for years by the time she got to the bigbox consumer electronics store in 2014 but never experienced anything like the treatment she received working on the geek squad she said at her first store men would make comments about her appearance but she was often able to hide out in a back room but when tremblay transferred to a different location things took a turn the only woman on a team of 10 she was often singled out on one occasion in 2018 while helping a man with his laptop the guy suddenly put his arm around her grabbed her hip and forced his mouth onto her neck slobbering on it according to the filing when she told her supervisor he suggested she take a minute to compose herself before heading back out on the store floor he didnt summon security or take any kind of action according to the complaint the man returned a few hours later snuck up behind tremblay and whispered i love you in her ear when tremblay told her supervisor again what happened he laughed according to the complaint people are always trying to hug you i didnt think it bothered you so much he said according to the complaint she raised the issue with the stores general manager and was told the harassment was part of working with the public her manager also told her that black workers at best buy were often harassed and theyd learned to live with it tremblay said she was shocked she called a corporate hotline put her complaint in writing and sent it to an hr executive two years after she had been working at best buy tremblay was forced to sign an agreement waiving her rights to sue the company until recently her lawyers believed this meant she would have to take her case to arbitration essentially a private courtroom where the company has the upper hand however in 2018 at the height of the metoo movement new york state banned forced arbitration in sexual harassment or discrimination cases and earlier this month new york state judge louis nock ruled in favor of a woman who was trying to sue luxury goods company lvmh moet for sexual discrimination despite an arbitration agreement heartened tremblays lawyers at brooklyn new york firm crumiller pc decided to push forward with a lawsuit our original plan was just to arbitrate which we do regularly its not optimal but until last week we understood that such agreements would be upheld so we didnt waste time going into court said susan crumiller the firms founder she expects that the issue of whether this case can go to court will be appealed this is not the first time former geek squad members have complained about mistreatment the company was sued by a former female employee for race and sex discrimination in new york city in 2016 current and former best buy employees do you have a story of harassment to share email emilypeckhuffpostcom last month after nationwide protests over police brutality best buy ceo corrie barry wrote an open letter pledging to do better when it comes to diversity and inclusion at the very least even if her lawsuit doesnt work out tremblay said she hoped the company would develop some kind of code of conduct for dealing with bad customer behavior even some comic book stores have something like that she said in an open letter to barry that she wrote earlier this month when her lawsuit seemed destined for arbitration tremblay asked to at least be able to argue her case in open court as a victim being silenced is hard on a personal level but to think that my efforts could have no benefit to future female best buy employees who may suffer exactly as i have suffered is unspeakably disheartening she wrote it is the ultimate disempowerment

worldnews baghdad ap iraqis voted sunday in parliamentary elections held months ahead of schedule as a concession to a youthled popular uprising against corruption and mismanagement but the voting was marked by widespread apathy and a boycott by many of the young activists who thronged the streets of baghdad and iraqs southern provinces in late 2019 tens of thousands of people took part in the mass protests and were met by security forces firing live ammunition and tear gas more than 600 people were killed and thousands injured within just a few months although authorities gave in and called the early elections the death toll and the heavyhanded crackdown as well as a string of targeted assassinations prompted many who took part in the protests to later call for a boycott of the vote polls closed at 1500 gmt 1800 local time following 11 hours of voting results are expected within the next 24 hours according to the independent body that oversees iraqs election but negotiations to choose a prime minister tasked with forming a government are expected to drag on for weeks or even months the election was the sixth held since the fall of saddam hussein after the usled invasion of iraq in 2003 many were skeptical that independent candidates from the protest movement stood a chance against wellentrenched parties and politicians many of them backed by powerful armed militias minutes after polls closed fireworks organized by baghdads municipality went off in the citys landmark tahrir square where demonstrators had set up tents for several months starting in october 2019 the protests fizzled out by february of the following year due to the security crackdown and later the coronavirus pandemic today the square stands largely empty the country faces huge economic and security challenges and although most iraqis long for change few expect it to happen as a result of the elections muna hussein a 22yearold cinematic makeup artist said she boycotted the election because she did not feel there was a safe environment with uncontrolled weapons everywhere a reference to the mainly shiite militias backed by neighboring iran in my opinion it isnt easy to hold free and fair elections under the current circumstances she said amir fadel a 22yearold car dealer disagreed i dont want these same faces and same parties to return he said after casting his ballot in baghdads karradah district iraqs prime minister mustafa alkadhimi whose chances for a second term will be determined by the results of the election urged iraqis to vote in large numbers get out and vote and change your future said alkadhimi repeating the phrase get out three times after casting his ballot at a school in baghdads heavily fortified green zone home to foreign embassies and government offices under iraqs laws the winner of sundays vote gets to choose the countrys next prime minister but its unlikely any of the competing coalitions can secure a clear majority that will require a lengthy process involving backroom negotiations to select a consensus prime minister and agree on a new coalition government it took eight months of political wrangling to form a government after the 2018 elections groups drawn from iraqs majority shiite muslims dominate the electoral landscape with a tight race expected between iraqs influential shiite cleric moqtada alsadr and the fatah alliance led by paramilitary leader hadi alameri which came in second in the previous election the fatah alliance is comprised of parties and affiliated with the popular mobilization forces an umbrella group of mostly proiran shiite militias that rose to prominence during the war against the sunni extremist islamic state group it includes some of the most hardline iranbacked factions such as the asaib ahl alhaq militia alsadr a blackturbaned nationalist leader is also close to iran but publicly rejects its political influence earlier sunday alsadr cast his ballot in the shiite holy city of najaf swarmed by local journalists he then drove away in a white sedan without commenting alsadr a populist who has an immense following among iraqs working class shiites came out on top in the 2018 elections winning a majority of seats the election is the first since the fall of saddam to proceed without a curfew in place reflecting the significantly improved security situation in the country following the defeat of is in 2017 previous votes were marred by fighting and deadly bomb attacks that have plagued the country for decades more than 250000 security personnel across the country were tasked with protecting the vote soldiers police and antiterrorism forces fanned out and deployed outside polling stations some of which were ringed by barbed wire voters were patted down and searched as a security precaution iraq closed its airspace and land border crossings and scrambled its air force from saturday night until early monday morning in another first sundays election is taking place under a new election law that divides iraq into smaller constituencies another demand of the activists who took part in the 2019 protests and allows for more independent candidates the 2018 elections saw just 44 of eligible voters cast their ballots a record low and the results were widely contested there are concerns of a similar or even lower turnout this time in a tea shop in karradah one of the few open candidate reem abdulhadi walked in to ask whether people had cast their vote i will give my vote to umm kalthoum the singer she is the only one who deserves it the tea vendor quipped referring to the late egyptian singer beloved by many in the arab world he said he will not take part in the election and didnt believe in the political process after a few words abdulhadi gave the man who asked to remain anonymous a card with her name and number in case he changed his mind he put it in his pocket thank you i will keep it as a souvenir he said at that moment a lowflying highspeed military aircraft flew overhead making a screeching noise listen to this this sound is terror it reminds me of war not an election he added we remain committed to providing you

economy they are two young girls from two very different worlds linked by a global industry that exploits an army of children olivia chaffin a girl scout in rural tennessee was a top cookie seller in her troop when she first heard rainforests were being destroyed to make way for everexpanding palm oil plantations on one of those plantations a continent away 10yearold ima helped harvest the fruit that makes its way into a dizzying array of products sold by leading western food and cosmetics brands ima is among the estimated tens of thousands of children often working alongside their parents in indonesia and malaysia which supply 85 of the worlds most consumed vegetable oil an associated press investigation found most earn little or no pay and are routinely exposed to toxic chemicals and other hazardous conditions some never go to school or learn to read and write others are smuggled across borders and left vulnerable to trafficking or sexual abuse the ap used us customs records and the most recently published data from producers traders and buyers to trace the fruits of their labor from the processing mills where palm kernels were crushed to the supply chains of many popular kids cereals candies and ice creams sold by nestle unilever kelloggs pepsico and many other leading food companies including ferrero one of the two makers of girl scout cookies olivia who earned a badge for selling more than 600 boxes of cookies had spotted palm oil as an ingredient on the back of one of her packages but was relieved to see a green tree logo next to the words certified sustainable she assumed that meant her thin mints and tagalongs werent harming rainforests orangutans or those harvesting the orangered palm fruit but later the whipsmart 11yearold saw the word mixed on the label and quickly learned it meant exactly what she feared sustainable palm oil had been blended with oil from unsustainable sources to her that meant the cookies she was peddling were tainted thousands of miles away in indonesia ima led her class in math and dreamed of becoming a doctor then her father made her quit school to help meet his high company targets on the palm oil plantation where she was born instead of attending fourth grade she squatted in the unrelenting heat snatching up the loose kernels littering the ground she sometimes worked 12 hours a day wearing only flip flops and no gloves crying when the fruits razorsharp spikes bloodied her hands or scorpions stung her fingers the loads she carried went to one of the very mills feeding into the supply chain of olivias cookies i am dreaming one day i can go back to school she told the ap child labor has long been a dark stain on the 65 billion global palm oil industry identified as a problem by rights groups the united nations and the us government with little or no access to daycare some young children in both countries follow their parents to the fields in some cases an entire family may earn less in a day than a 5 box of girl scout dosidos for 100 years families have been stuck in a cycle of poverty and they know nothing else than work on a palm oil plantation said researcher kartika manurung who has published reports detailing labor issues on indonesian plantations the aps investigation into child labor is part of a broader indepth look at the industry that also exposed rape forced labor trafficking and slavery reporters crisscrossed malaysia and indonesia speaking to more than 130 current and former workers some two dozen of them child laborers at nearly 25 companies indonesian government officials said they do not know how many children work in the countrys massive palm oil industry but the uns international labor organization has estimated 15 million children between 10 and 17 years old labor in its agricultural sector palm oil is one of the largest crops employing some 16 million people in much smaller neighboring malaysia a newly released government report estimated more than 33000 children work in the industry there nearly half of them between the ages of 5 and 11 that report did not directly address the tens of thousands of socalled stateless boys and girls living in the country with parents who came from bordering countries an official from malaysias ministry of plantation industries and commodities did not respond to repeated requests for comment but nageeb wahab head of the malaysian palm oil association called allegations of child labor very serious and urged complaints to be reported to authorities soes hindharno an official from indonesias manpower ministry said he had not received any complaints about child labor occurring in his own country but an official from the ministry that oversees women and childrens issues labeled it an area of growing concern many producers western buyers and banks belong to the 4000member roundtable on sustainable palm oil a global association that provides a green stamp of approval to those committed to dealing with palm oil thats been certified as ethically sourced the rspo has a system in place to address grievances including labor abuse allegations but of the nearly 100 complaints listed on its case tracker in the last decade in the two southeast asian countries only a handful have mentioned children dan strechay the rspos global outreach and engagement director said the association has started working with unicef and others to educate members about what constitutes child labor palm oil is contained in roughly half the products on supermarket shelves and in almost three out of every four cosmetic brands and many kids are introduced to it the day theyre born its a primary fat in infant formula as they grow its present in many of their favorite foods its in their poptarts and capn crunch cereal oreo cookies kitkat candy bars magnum ice cream doughnuts and even bubble gum olivia is not the first girl scout to raise questions about the way palm oil makes its way into the cookies more than a decade ago two girls in a michigan troop campaigned against its use leading the girl scouts of the usa to join the rspo and agree to start using sustainable palm oil adding the green tree logo to its roughly 200 million boxes of cookies which bring in nearly 800 million annually the girl scouts did not respond to questions from the ap directing reporters to the two bakers that make the cookies little brownie bakers in kentucky and abc bakers in virginia those companies and their parent corporations ferrero and weston foods respectively also did not comment on the findings but both said they were committed to sourcing only certified sustainable palm oil when contacted by the ap other companies affirmed their support of human rights for all workers with some noting they rely on their suppliers to meet industry standards and abide by local laws if evidence of wrongdoing is found some said they would immediately cut ties with producers we aim to prevent and address the issue

environment if you follow the popular polls you might think that americans are growing ever more skeptical about manmade climate change despite the consensus among published climate scientists thats simply not true jon krosnick of stanford university told an audience of social scientists and cognitive researchers wednesday in garrison ny he maintained that most americans do in fact believe the problem krosnick said during his talk at the garrison institutes annual climate mind and behavior symposium is that we havent been asking the public the right questions the other problem legislators are reading their misleading answers and hearing from a vocal minority of constituents public opinion has the potential to move legislators he said but methods that political scientists are using to document the public will are going at a snails pace with funding from major news outlets such as reuters and abc news krosnicks team has been conducting its own national surveys over the last several years since 2009 their findings have diverged from those of other survey organizations gallup and pew polls show that the percentage of americans that believe in climate change now hovers around 50 percent but krosnicks latest poll which asked the question in a more detailed way suggests the figure is 83 percent up from 79 percent in 1997 of the global warming believers the majority also reported thinking that the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities play a role the trend held after the researchers broke the data down by political party 66 percent of republicans said climate change is happening further not a single us state had a majority opinion on the skeptical side noted krosnick even in oklahoma the home of one of the countrys most outspoken skeptics sen james inhofe rokla a large majority of the people polled agreed with the scientific consensus anthony leiserowitz director of the yale project on climate change communication doesnt share the same optimism combining various public opinion polls including krosnicks he sees a downward trend in the percentage of americans believing in global warming since 2007 further in a new openended poll hes found that the first thing that came to the minds of 23 percent of people when they thought about climate change was a naysayer thought such as a recent record snowstorm or a conspiracy theory this is up from 7 percent in 2003 he told the huffington post krosnick and his colleagues also looked at two ways of framing a question about the publics ranking of issues in response to what is the most important problem facing this country today the economy ranked at the top with global warming dead last when this question was reworded to ask what will be the most important problem facing the world in the future if nothing is done to stop it the results were reversed global warming ranked no 1 this message is not getting across to washington said krosnick scott brophy a philosophy professor at hobart and william smith colleges agreed that politicians are out of touch with the thinking of their constituents yet the problem remains he said that 1 in every 3 or 4 americans doesnt believe in a basic fact for democracy to work according to brophy we need to understand how and why people dont trust the scientific facts research has shown that people are motivated to find information that supports their beliefs encountering counterarguments causes us to marshal forces like an army of white blood cells to defend against them said brophy he pointed to the influence of massive disinformation campaigns such as the recently outed heartland institute this is a real threat to democracy he told huffpost we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone

rule added bob doppelt executive director of the resource innovation group a nonprofit organization affiliated with willamette university its driven by elites that paid for fund and have the most access and therefore the most influence over officials in a way the whole discussion is beside the point according to brophy the question we should be asking he said what are the policies we should adopt there reasonable people can disagree policy doesnt automatically follow from the facts added brophy yet we continue arguing about whether the earth is round this is crazy

technology connected devices have proliferated faster than legal and ethical frameworks can keep up in october when malware called mirai took over poorly secured webcams and dvrs and used them to disrupt internet access across the united states i wondered who was responsible not who actually coded the malware or who unleashed it on an essential piece of the internets infrastructure instead i wanted to know if anybody could be held legally responsible could the unsecure devices manufacturers be liable for the damage their products could the unsecure devices manufacturers be liable for the damage their products right now in this early stage of connected devices slow invasion into our daily lives theres no clear answer to that question thats because theres no real legal framework that would hold manufacturers responsible for critical failures that harm others as is often the case the technology has developed far faster than policies and regulations but its not just the legal system thats out of touch with the new connected reality the internet of things as its called is also lacking a critical ethical framework argues francine berman a computerscience professor at rensselaer polytechnic institute and a longtime expert on computer infrastructure together with vint cerf an engineer considered one of the fathers of the internet berman wrote an article in the journal communications of the association for computing machinery about the need for an ethical system i spoke to her about ethical design and how to balance individual privacy with the potential for social good of connected devices that share data with one another a transcript of our conversation lightly edited for concision and clarity follows related porn star james deens crisis of conscience kaveh waddell why is it particularly important to think about ethics in the internet of things francine berman i think weve been running up against these issues as digital technologies become more and more prevalent but the internet of things is particularly interesting first of all were just at the tip of the iceberg in what is arguably going to be a brave new world and its highly heterogenous well be seeing a lot more autonomous systems well be seeing enhanced humans and smart systems devices and organizations when you put all of those together and you start thinking about how to bring out the best of the internet of things rather than the worst of the internet of things governance is really the key that means understanding how to design and build and think about these systems whos responsible and whos accountable what does it mean to be ethical and what does it mean to promote the public good waddell whats another example of a new technology driving the creation a new ethical framework berman think about the industrial revolution the technologies were very compelling but perhaps the most compelling part were the social differences it created during the industrial revolution you saw a move to the cities you saw the first childlabor laws you saw manufacturing really come to the fore things were available that had not been very available before there was a workforce evolution in some sense the information age has had that same kind of impact on all aspects of life and the internet of things exacerbates it because now the boundaries between the physical world and the biological world and the cyber world are blending were bumping into something thats going to have a tremendous impact in the way we live what we do how we think about things and even our individual rights waddell have we seen a shift in governance in the information age in the way we did at the beginning of the industrial revolution berman well sure you think about something like copyright that was around at the time of the constitution and now were worrying about whether stairway to heaven is a copyright infringement theres a lot of things were looking at now that we never even imagined wed have to think about a great example what if selfdriving cars have to make bad choices how do they do that where are the ethics and then who is accountable for the choices that are made by autonomous systems this needs to be more of a priority and we need to be thinking about it more broadly we need to start designing the systems that are going to be able to support social regulation social policy and social practice to bring out the best of the internet of things waddell what would those supporting systems look like berman think about designing a car i want to design it so its safe and so that the opportunity to hack my car is minimized if i design internet of things systems that are effective provide me a lot of opportunities and are adaptive but i only worry about really important things like security and privacy and safety afterwards its much less effective than designing them with those things in mind we can lessen the number of unintended consequences if we start thinking from the design stage and the innovation stage how were going to use these technologies then we put into place the corresponding social framework related torching the modernday library of alexandria waddell i want to ask a little more about attribution how for example should we think about assigning responsibility for the mirai botnet that harnessed internet of things devices to attack core internet infrastructure last year who should be held responsible for that berman thats a really great question theres a shared responsibility between innovators companies the government and the individual to try and create and utilize a framework that assigns responsibility and accountability based on what promotes the public good think about medicine in trying to treat symptoms and cure diseases the medical community creates medication some medications are available over the counter and some medications require a prescription because you need guidance from your doctor some medications can only be administered in the hospital because theyre very specialized or dangerous we have a whole social and policy framework to govern the use and administration of medicine even if it doesnt work perfectly whose purpose is to keep you safe and promote individual and public health waddell how do we create a framework like that does it start with creating a new system of regulations berman we have to be careful with regulations because we want to make sure we have thoughtful regulations that promote the public good instead of get in the way of things the internet of things is just emerging so this is a great time for experimentation if you think about a smart city or a smart system or a smart building or even an intensivecare ward you have a lot of devices and systems that share information you have policy issues you have privacy issues this is a great time for us to start experimenting with things that make sense and getting some feedback the national institute of standards and technology is doing some really interesting work on cyberphysical systems and theyre starting to develop standards that would help people keep things private well have more experience with that as people start putting that into practice some of it will work very well and some of it wont and that will help us iteratively improve it you cant come out full force with a law about something you dont really know about because its unlikely to work effectively but we can get a lot of experience in more circumscribed systems now and if we make it a priority and we start looking at smart cities in that way or smart buildings then i think we have a chance of starting to organically grow a sensible governance and ethical system for the internet of things waddell how do you balance individual privacy with the greater community good that can come from harvesting large amounts of personal data berman i think were dealing with this bit by bit when you travel to a foreign country and you come back and the customs agent asks you where youve been theyre really asking a question that you might think is private information but youre willing to share with them whether youre on a farm or whether youre bringing back vegetables things that can be dangerous to the public good so were already making those decisions all the time the internet of things is exacerbated by the sheer technical challenge of trying to do things adaptively and preferentially so imagine that i can decide whether for example my address can appear on google maps then google maps becomes less valuable and its hard to even imagine what kind of technical infrastructure you would need to maintain or who would maintain it to make that happen so there will always be tradeoffs and theyll always be in the gray area between extreme personal privacy and everything being transparent for the public good waddell has anybody struck that balance particularly well berman thats a good question in some sense thats an individual opinion im okay telling people whether or not ive been on a farm when i come back from a trip but there are other places where im not so comfortable i might feel that my device taking data and sharing data is too intrusive for me one question i have is whether the generation of people who grew up with having their devices be a part of their lives versus the generations that didnt will have different ideas about whats okay and whats not okay waddell i also wonder if people who see what they might gain from participating in a larger communityoriented datagathering process might shift their attitudes for example digital assistants like siri learn from the people that use them when you use siri youre helping teach itdoes that make people decide its worth it to give up a small amount of privacy to have a more useful digital assistant berman i agree with that a key question is are there negative repercussions to having people know about a particular thing i think in a lot of instances there are no negative repercussions people might perceive a much greater benefit to sharing things outweighing the downside health data is a good example of something where there can be negative repercussions to sharing things and so we have a lot of privacy laws around that but some people may not feel that way so you see things like patients like me a website where patients can share their medical details and meet others who share their symptoms we all make those decisions at an individual level but for the internet of things i think its very important for us to think of it at a societal level related growing old in new yorks snarkiest earlyinternet community waddell to me one of the biggest problems with the internet of things right now is that manufacturers are making poorly secured devices in their rush to connect every little thing they make to the internet is there any way to stop that from happening without turning to regulations and laws berman i was talking to someone the other day about baby monitors which can be both great and pretty scary its great to be able to monitor your baby and make sure that theyre okay and its really scary when people are shrieking at your baby over the internet because your baby monitor got hacked thats poor design i think the geewhiz aspects of the internet of things get a lot of attention oh i can do this and the system adapts to me in this way and i never have to turn on the lights in my house again because my house is doing it for me but i think its equally important to be thinking on the social side we dont want to as you point out rush to the final result which is maybe legislation or policy without a lot of experience and testing and thinking about whats in the public good waddell are people getting distracted by that geewhiz factor the novelty of alexa and internetconnected lights are we in the honeymoon stage right now berman right infrastructure is never newsworthy until it fails to get people to think about and prioritize getting infrastructure right and governance and ethics and policy and socialinterest structure is hard typically were interested in the results and the breakthroughs and the discoveries or the really bad things that happen like losing socialsecurity numbers or getting hacked its not newsworthy to say the water main is working or the lights are still on waddell the mirai botnet and the attack on the internet probably did a lot to bring infrastructure into headlines if people keep thinking about it do you think some of these cultural shifts might come about a little earlier berman this is something where your periodical and a lot of other important ones can really help because you can bring it to peoples attention we need more than just innovators and designers to think about it we really need the stakeholders to think about it policymakers the private sector leadership and csuite people the general public waddell whats one ethical guideline that internet of things manufacturers should be keeping in their sights when they are developing new products berman security is critical for all of our technologies security is the achilles heel if we want it to be used for benefit we have to think about security and we have to think about privacy too what data is private and what isnt and are we engineering our systems so that they can support whatever privacy concerns we have this story originally appeared on theatlanticcom more from the atlantic the lifechanging magic of mushrooms the different stakes of

sports of all popular sports most of which are dominated by men tennis is the one thats been the closest to a model of gender equality starting with billie jean kings work and her 1973 battle of the sexes match tennis has paved the way leaping ahead of its time in 2007 when the world tennis association wta helped secure equal pay for mens and womens players in all four majors the gender wage gap remains a critical societal issue but in tennis they got it right way before many organizations eight years later some leaders in the tennis world namely a handful of rich white men are using their platform to scrutinize and openly question equal pay in their sport these men apparently want to drag tennis back to the wrong side of history and in doing so have revealed their true nature in the sexist language theyve used to argue against equal pay and so on monday former romanian tennis champion ion tiriac whos now a 76yearold billionaire and the owner of the madrid open joined the likes of world no 1 novak djokovic and former indian wells ceo raymond moore in his sexist equal pay takedown i like very much more women than men said tiriac to the new york times in a story published on monday thats great tiriac whats the reasoning there all my life ive done that the longer the legs theirs are the more beautiful i think they are he said even in tennis theyre gracious and so on but i dont see the equal prize money being the status maybe they deserve more pay more the women if they deserve nope nope nope as discussed in relation to the us womens soccer lawsuit for equal pay its not a matter of deserving more money or paying players based on revenue its a matter of policy fairness and adjusting the pay scales to account for a history of womens marginalization within sports its the right thing to do still dont believe in equal pay tiriacs objectification of womens players reducing them to longlegged and gracious feminine stereotypes female athletes like men come in all shapes and playing styles only punctuates why equal pay is necessary and must continue in tennis because hes not alone in march indian wells ceo and former player raymond moore stepped down following his own sexist rant he came under fire after saying that womens players ride on the coattails of the men and should go down every night on their knees to thank the games male players for supposedly carrying the sport serena williams is tennis biggest star if anyone needs reminding djokovic followed moores comments by suggesting that men may actually deserve more money than women and should fight for it saying its ok to purposefully pay women less for equal work is degrading and it flows from the inherent sexism our patriarchy produces and tolerates the comments from tiriac moore and to a lesser degree djokovic are pure byproducts of that ironically the madrid open already offers equal pay but tiriac is reportedly discussing its continuation with the wta because of stated viability concerns the billionaire says hell go broke if women receive pay increases outlined by the association of tennis professionals atp this is of course nonsense tiriac himself claims that the madrid open has an annual net profit of about 40 million and hauls in over 220 million in revenue each year and his millions in profits arent because he only does a mens tournament the madrid open features both genders and is packaged and sold thusly wta chief executive steve simon noted that to the times in his response to tiriacs quotes completely shutting down any debate over the future of equal pay its promoted as men and women all towards that brand and product and he sells it as one and so on that basis equal is certainly right he said we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again

worldnews kyiv ukraine ap russian renewed its shelling in the area of ukraines zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant a local official said wednesday a day after the un atomic watchdog agency pressed for the warring sides to carve out a safe zone there to protect against a possible catastrophe the city of nikopol located on the opposite bank of the dnieper river from europes largest nuclear power plant was fired on with rockets and heavy artillery regional governor valentyn reznichenko said the reports of nearby shelling which couldnt be independently verified have caused international alarm the head of the international atomic energy agency rafael grossi warned the un security council on tuesday that something very very catastrophic could take place at zaporizhzhia there are fires blackouts and other things at the plant that force us to prepare the local population for the consequences of the nuclear danger reznichenko said the potential peril led the un atomic watchdog agency to urge russia and ukraine to establish a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the plant there are fears the fighting could trigger a catastrophe on the scale of the chernobyl disaster in 1986 the plant was built during the soviet era and is one of the 10 biggest in the world neither moscow nor kiev officials would immediately commit to the idea of a safety zone saying more details of the proposal were needed russian president vladimir putin defied pressure to halt the war saying wednesday that moscow will forge ahead with its military offensive in ukraine until it achieves its goals he also mocked western attempts to stop russia with sanctions the eastern city of sloviansk came under russian fire on wednesday morning damaging a school and another building according to the head of the city administration vadym lyakh he said the number of injuries wasnt yet known three civilians were killed in russian shelling in the donetsk region the ukrainian presidential office said kharkiv city was hit by rockets twice during the night but ukrainian forces have taken control of an unspecified number of towns in the kherson region according to nataliya humenyuk a spokesperson for the southern military command she said details would come later from the military leadership the uk defense ministry said there had been heavy fighting on three fronts in the north near kharkiv in the east in the donbas and in the south in kherson oblast amid a ukrainian counterattack in the east multiple concurrent threats spread across 500 kilometers 310 miles will test russias ability to coordinate operational design and reallocate resources across multiple groupings of forces the ministry said wednesday the russian military held largescale military drills that began last week and ended wednesday in the countrys east that involved forces from china it was seen as another show of increasingly close ties between moscow and beijing amid tensions with the west over the military action in ukraine follow the aps coverage of the war at httpsapnewscomhubrussiaukraine
health egg freezing has been touted as a way for women to put off having children giving them more time to work on their careers or search for the right partner but a new study finds that few women who freeze their eggs actually end up using them in the study researchers in australia surveyed nearly 100 women who had elected to freeze their eggs between 1999 and 2014 as a way to delay childbearing none of the women in the study had a medical reason for freezing their eggs on average the women were 37 years old at the time they froze their eggs and 40 years old at the time they completed the survey the majority of women 86 percent were single when they froze their eggs and most 67 percent were single at the time they completed the survey overall just 6 percent of the women had used their frozen eggs at the time of the survey and 3 percent had given birth using the frozen eggs 5 myths about fertility treatments about 1 in 5 of the women 22 percent had been pregnant at some point since freezing their eggs in most of these cases the women had conceived naturally or had undergone in vitro fertilization using fresh eggs rather than their frozen eggs and some of the women had had miscarriages when asked why they hadnt yet used their frozen eggs most of the women said that they didnt want to be a single parent or that they wanted to try to conceive naturally and when asked if they still planned to use their frozen eggs nearly 70 percent said it would depend on their circumstances while just 21 percent said they were definitely planning to use their eggs the researchers concluded that information on the proportion of women who return to use their stored eggs as well as information about their reasons for not using the eggs and their overall pregnancy outcomes might help women to make more informed decisions about whether to freeze oocytes they wrote in the jan 6 issue of the journal human reproduction previous studies have had similar findings for example researchers at one fertility clinic in santa monica california found that from 2007 to 2012 232 women froze their eggs at the clinic to delay childbearing but 95 percent of these women still had not used their eggs by 2015 5 surprising facts about egg freezing its important to note that many women in the new study had only recently frozen their eggs nearly half the women said they had frozen their eggs within the last two years and this may in part explain why so few women reported using their eggs the researchers said in addition the researchers noted that 6 percent of women in the study who ended up using their eggs had all used an older method for egg freezing known as slow freezing and only half of these women who tried to use the eggs frozen by this method ended up having a baby with their frozen eggs but the women who froze their eggs in more recent years after 2012 used a newer technology for egg freezing called vitrification and although its too soon to tell its possible that the women who used this method will have a greater chance of having a baby using their frozen eggs the researchers said still these results demonstrate the diverse potential reproductive outcomes and reproductive heterogeneity of women who freeze oocytes for nonmedical reasons they said when using frozen eggs the chances of pregnancy depend in part on how old women are when they froze their eggs and the number of eggs they chose to freeze a 2016 study found that the chances of having at least one baby from eight frozen eggs was 41 percent in women who are younger than 35 when they freeze their eggs and 20 percent in women who are 35 or older when they freeze their eggs the new study was funded by melbourne ivf the fertility clinic where participants went to freeze their eggs

economy in the face of the chaos and confusion that come with raising a family today parents across america turn to a very specific place for sanctuary and relief while it may not be fancy or private its got an air of sophistication and serenity what is this magical place well target apparently its no secret that parents particularly moms love to love target they write rhapsodizing blog posts create fan instagram accounts draw comics and tweet endlessly about their target obsessions at least one mom chose to take her maternity photos at a target store and another even gave birth to her child in one albeit unintentionally but what exactly is it that makes target so appealing to moms and dads we spoke to marketing experts therapists and parents themselves to find out i never thought dashing to target without kids would feel like a minivacation but it does and sometimes thats all a mom of little kids needs to recharge mom and blogger jennifer s white told huffpost the bad part about going to target by yourself on a saturday night is absolutely nothing its one of the worlds purest joys husband just go to target by yourself ill put the kids to bed mommy porn indeed many parents find that target offers them an opportunity to escape the chaos and stress at home without feeling guilty because after all theyre running errands and buying necessities and some nonnecessities too for their families target is close by and a more socially acceptable place for parents to sneak away to solo than say a bar said mom and blogger samantha taylor who also told huffpost she sees solo target trips as minivacations jennifer cutler an assistant professor of marketing at northwestern universitys kellogg school of management believes target offers a sense of whimsical escapism that particularly appeals to parents i never thought dashing to target without kids would feel like a minivacation but it does part of its brand is trying to make the shopping experience a treat one thing that parents have in common is a shortage of time being able to reframe the drudgery of running errands as whimsical escapism is really powerful she told huffpost pointing out the colorful and even magical imagery in the brands marketing materials its saying come to this magical place where you can get whatever your heart desires a clean friendly place with starbucks coffee and popcorn waiting for you cutler added i think that really resonates because it joins a productive activity with something whimsical and almost vacationlike in the experience the convenience and affordability of a bigbox store are undeniable as well target is so addictive because it has everything you need from batteries to groceries to cat litter and it has a bunch of stuff you dont need but really want when you see it like supercute earrings for you and cheap adorable outfit separates for your kids taylor explained we feel guilty about going on a frivolous shopping binge but not about throwing a 5 pair of clearance earrings in with the cleaning supplies inside our cart still it goes beyond the convenience and low prices which many major stores offer the physical experience of being in a target store is another reason parents give for their fandom walking into a target is a mild high in itself said taylor that food court and smell of popcorn that cute little dog that comfortingly simple logo that dollar spot where everything is actually 3 but thats ok walking into a target is a mild high in itself the blogger also also cited the presence of starbucks in many targets hello strolling the racks under the guise of shopping for necessities with a steaming caramel macchiato the neat appearance of the stores can also feel refreshing for parents as households with young kids are not necessarily so clean and organized said mabel yiu a licensed marriage and family therapist and mother of twins you walk into target and the lighting the colors even the smell really capture you because it feels great said yiu its like it increases the dopamine in the brain you see that everything is really wellorganized and even colorcoded as a mom my home doesnt look like that so you walk in and think this is really great dad and blogger beau coffron echoed this sentiment they do a great job of keeping the aisles organized so you dont feel like youre in the middle of a tornado with stuff everywhere like some stores are he told huffpost the look and feel of target stores appeal to consumers different senses from the sound of upbeat music to the scent of coffee and popcorn rima touretillery an assistant professor at the kellogg school who studies the intersection of motivation and selfperception in marketing said the inviting appearance of target relates to the brands colors red and white research shows that people see red as a fun fiery daring color and the color of love meanwhile white gives a sense of cleanliness spaciousness and elegance these associations are not things people consciously think about but they influence you said touretillery so just being exposed to the red and white in the store can give you an impression of sophistication maybe that explains why people say tarjay to make the store sound fancier collaborations with highend brands like proenza schouler missoni and jason wu also add to this classier image brands arent stupid theyre studying this and the retail environment theyre trying to create is to maximize the experience the memories the emotion store layouts and color schemes are typically very conscious choices meant to appeal to consumers brands arent stupid theyre studying this and the retail environment theyre trying to create is to maximize the experience the memories the emotion said the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania marketing professor americus reed noting that there are design principles meant to pique shoppers curiosity and guide them through the store store designs can also appeal to children shopping with their parents aisles are designed a certain way things that are going to be important for kids are lower to the ground thats for a reason reed told huffpost in the case of target parents can use the presence of toys and other fun things for kids to their advantage by using them as potential rewards for good behavior in the store i prefer to shop target alone as a sort of pathetic minivacation but if i bring my kids i like to keep them strapped in to the baby seat whenever possible taylor told huffpost usually ill reward them with a trip to the toy aisle just to look if they behave creating a memorable appealing shopping experience is crucial in the age of online retail giants indeed recent reports have shown disappointing profits for target as it competes with amazon behemoths like amazon are commoditizing convenience people dont want to go out and be physically in stores as much anymore because you can just hop online and get a box in a few hours reed said you have to create other experiences in a shopping context that are going to make it worthwhile to go out and do that instead of going to amazoncom so maybe thats creating some more motivational impetus for these brands like target to craft a richer experience for parents and children going in the store one way to combat the growing influence of amazon happens to be another reason experts cited when exploring why parents are so obsessed with target identity loyalty the concept is that there are some brands for which the brand itself transcends the functional features the utilitarian benefits in terms of what it does and it becomes something that is part of who you are reed explained when the brand becomes part and parcel with some important aspect of your desired selfexpression then the brands identity and your own identity become fused its like the brand is part of who you are and you have loyalty to it because its a symbol of what you aspire to express to other people kellogg marketing professor angela lee echoed that many young moms identify with target with the image of fun and fashionable that the store projects thats what it means when one is a committed loyalist the brand becomes part of the self its like the brand is part of who you are and you have loyalty to it because its a symbol of what you aspire to express to other people when brands achieve identity loyalty they essentially have a free marketing department loyal followers proselytize and also defend the brand against criticism because an attack on the brand feels in some way like an attack on the self in some ways ones identity as a parent can become wrapped up in a store like target at the end of a shopping trip you have shopped for many aspects of your life you got birthday gifts for a kids party gifts for your inlaws yoga pants for exercising work clothes etc you walk out feeling very accomplished and competent yiu explained and your selfimage matches the idealized self you see in target ads showing happy competent parents white told huffpost shes noticed many kids love target almost as much as their parents do once i took my kids out for ice cream it was a surprise and i expected them to be thrilled white recalled they werent they looked out the window across the street to target and said they wanted to go there for their surprise instead my 3yearold i wish we could just live here at target me welling up with tears i know baby i know in this way the store creates opportunities for parenting wins ways to live up to an idealized image of a perfect parent the connection between target and identity might also involve the companys values and stances on specific issues like its support for breastfeeding mothers and transgender people white told huffpost she supports the companys attention to many issues that matter to parents target has done an incredible job attempting to stay on top of current parental concerns like clothing and gender and making the store accessible for families with special needs theyre family conscious and socially conscious so its a cool brand to be behind and something to be proud of said kathy morelli a new jerseybased mental health counselor target as a company is clearly quite aware of its cultlike status among moms target is much more than a place that just sells stuff were a meaningful part of the community and our guests lives from our registry benefits to baby musthaves to the many ways moms can shop and get their orders quickly and all at affordable prices we often hear that target is her happy place and thats a badge of honor we never take for granted executive vice president and chief marketing officer rick gomez told huffpost the company has even played into its friendly image with familyfocused initiatives like their first target run onesies we see a number of moms share on social that their first outing with their new baby is often to target its where they feel safe comfortable and know they can check off a few errands and maybe sneak in a treat or two for themselves said gomez we decided to have a little fun with this and thank moms who registered at target by sending them a surprise first target run onesie for their new baby it was a huge hit and a way to bring a little extra joy to moms during this special time of course target mania is not just a mom thing with studies showing dads are more involved in their childrens lives than ever and the growing number of samesex couples raising kids its no surprise many fathers are tweeting about their target runs too usually i feel great because i can pick up anything i want there and theres a location everywhere so i can stop on my way home from work or when im just trying to get my kids out of the house for a bit coffron told huffpost lets drink this icee while we look at bikes and easter candy and also pick up an entertainment center on our way to the checkout coffron said he and his wife also go to target on date nights we usually dont have much time with our kids being babysat so we grab a quick dinner and then go to target we are pretty much hopeless romantics i guess he said but seriously its fun because we can goof off and be silly but also be efficient because well just buy light bulbs at the same time when youre on a date with your wife at target and you have some fun at the self checkout with whoever is monitoring you pictwittercomlrezjhit9h reed said his 7yearold daughter loves going to target especially because she loves the popular lol surprise dolls you can buy there the professor said hes more than happy to take her on his target runs and occasionally indulge her with a toy parenting is the hardest job on the planet period he said anything that makes life a little easier that brings a little bit of joy to a child visvis what the parent is doing in this case running errands is seen as this fantastic elixir its fantastic i can take her to target and shell be happy and i can also do some shopping and get some stuff done of course there are always concerns about spending and unhealthful materialism when it comes to fanaticism around a specific brand given that the underlying mission is to sell you more products unfortunately this target movement is centered around consumerism so i cant say for sure if its good or bad morelli told huffpost but touretillery believes those concerns dont really apply to a brand like target i think if we were talking about a luxury brand that sells thousanddollar shoes then that would be more relevant to the discussion but target is not a luxury brand youre going to buy toilet paper and yogurt because you need those kinds of things and if you can go there and feel good about yourself and have fun in the process it really doesnt get better than that to say it all boils down to materialism also ignores another big appeal of the target experience something money doesnt necessarily buy community overworked parents particularly moms who still bear most of the burden when it comes to household responsibilities find comfort in knowing they arent alone and tend to seek a sense of community lets face it moms still do most of the shopping so it makes sense that they would be the ones to have this fun target fan club said touretillery because women tend to be more active on social media than men are it also makes sense that the social media component of target fandom would seem more momfocused a lot of moms actually gather at target so it provides some social support said yiu jennifer white told huffpost she finds a sense of comfort and community in her target runs even if shes only shopping with her children the best part of shopping at target is the convenience and that at least one mom always looks more frazzled than i do after my second child came along errands became stressful and overwhelming toting two young children and all their supplies suddenly i didnt run a quick errand anymore nothing was quick white said many times when i attempted a cute easy errand to target and it turned into a migraine id see other moms and wed smile knowingly at each other or wed make jokes over our kids heads she added that felt something like the village everyone wants but not all of us have

24 to 35 below 2005 levels by the end of the decade far short of bidens 50 to 52 goal the bill includes more than 100 climate and energy provisions the bulk of the spending comes in the form of clean energy tax credits grants and loans it provides 30 billion in incentives for companies to manufacture solar panels wind turbines and batteries as well as to process critical minerals theres another 10 billion in tax credits for the construction of new clean technology manufacturing facilities up to 20 billion in loans to build clean vehicle manufacturing plants and 500 million in defense production act funds for heat pumps and critical minerals processing the package would lower the cost of electric vehicles for low and middleincome americans with 7500 tax credits for new evs and 4500 for used ones and invest billions to electrify lowincome households additionally the bill earmarks 60 billion to confront legacy pollution and invest in lowincome and communities of color 27 billion for a socalled green bank to boost clean energy and slash emissions with a particular focus on disadvantaged communities 20 billion for climatefriendly agriculture and 5 billion in forest conservation grants it would also establish a fee on emissions of methane an extremely potent greenhouse gas that is released from a number of sources including oil and gas operations sen joe manchin dwva shocked democrats and republicans alike on thursday when he gave his blessing to the scaleddown 740 billion spending package which will raise taxes on the ultrawealthy to pay for investments in both climate and health care the decision came just two weeks after manchin who has proven himself a relentless thorn in democrats side seemingly torpedoed what was widely seen as a last chance for the party to pass meaningful climate legislation in a lengthy statement thursday and a subsequent interview friday with west virginia radio host hoppy kercheval manchin made it clear that his support hinged on support for fossil fuels the inflation reduction act of 2022 invests in the technologies needed for all fuel types from hydrogen nuclear renewables fossil fuels and energy storage to be produced and used in the cleanest way possible he said in his statement it is truly all of the above which means this bill does not arbitrarily shut off our abundant fossil fuels among other things the bill would reinstate oil and gas leases that companies obtained during a november 2021 auction and which a federal judge later vacated after concluding that the biden administration had failed to properly account for the climate impacts of the lease sale it also ties future renewable energy projects on federal lands to ongoing oil and gas development requiring the interior department to offer at auction at least 2 million acres onshore and 60 million acres offshore to oil and gas interests before it can proceed with wind solar and other renewable lease sales manchin also said he received a commitment from biden leader schumer and house speaker nancy pelosi dcalif to reform the federal permitting process for energy infrastructure including pipelines im saying straight to you without permitting reforms without the ability for america to do what it does best produce there is no bill manchin told kercheval on friday that is totally agreed upon and understood even with those fossil fuel concessions climate advocates and environmental groups largely celebrated the package leah stokes a climate policy expert at the university of california santa barbara who has advised democrats during the negotiations called it a game changer it would bring clean energy jobs to america and lower energy bills for american families stokes wrote on twitter it would get us 80 of the way to

center for biological diversity said in a statement its selfdefeating to handcuff renewable energy development to massive new oil and gas extraction the new leasing required in this bill will fan the flames of the climate disasters torching our country and its a slap in the face to the communities fighting to protect themselves from filthy fossil fuels

economy the recent mass store closures at retail chains toys r us and sears have spawned a campaign to guarantee severance pay to laidoff workers its backers now face their first big legislative test a bill in new jersey that would make severance a requirement for large employers if the proposal succeeds similar bills will almost certainly pop up in other states the way minimum wage laws and paid sick leave protections have spread across the country in recent years particularly in blue states at least thats the hope of workers like bruce miller he lost his job as a sears auto technician in 2018 when his store in toms river new jersey closed he had 36 years with the company and received eight weeks of severance pay an amount he believes should have been greater he said severance should be mandatory and based on an employees length of service most workers put their heart and soul into the job said miller 56 who testified in favor of the bill last week not getting severance after youve been there so many years its a punch in the gut its not fair to anybody out there the new jersey proposal which was recently introduced in the state senate would assure laidoff workers one week of pay for every year theyd worked at the company which would be paid out by the employer not the state had such a law been in place when sears was axing workers miller would have received roughly nine months of salary rather than two a greater financial cushion for him and a greater cost for sears the bill would make significant changes to the states mass layoff law which is based on the federal warn act in addition to the severance requirement it would increase the amount of advance notice that employers must give workers before making cuts from 60 days to 90 days employers who failed to give such a headsup would have to pay a minimum of four weeks of severance to an affected worker no matter how long the workers tenure the severance pay would come on top of the notice time during which the workers were still being paid meaning the severance wouldnt kick in until after the 90 days had passed the law would apply only to companies that were laying off 50 or more employees meaning smaller businesses wouldnt be on the hook even so business groups say the proposal worries them michael egenton a lobbyist with the new jersey chamber of commerce said the mandatory severance provision might be hard for failing businesses to meet he argued that employers might balk at expanding into new jersey if there were more workplace mandates noting also the recent passage of a law requiring a 15 minimum wage by 2024 our bigger concern is everyone is entitled to severance regardless of the financial situation egenton said adding that he had industries other than retail in mind i wouldnt want our members in the pharmaceutical bio industry to start getting nervous wondering what happens if they have to move employees around not getting severance after youve been there so many years its a punch in the gut as with the vast majority of states severance pay is currently optional in new jersey under most circumstances many companies therefore decline to offer any toys r us which was headquartered in wayne new jersey didnt give store employees the severance they expected after it announced last year that the chain was shutting down only when workers organized and embarrassed the chains owners did they establish a severance fund the effort in new jersey grew directly out of that toys r us campaign infuriated over the lack of severance former toys r us employees began publicly protesting against the bankrupt companys debtholders last year they took on the name rise up retail and began agitating for better protections for all retail workers who lose their jobs the effort is backed by the organization united for respect which has a history of organizing walmart employees and the liberal advocacy group center for popular democracy rise up retail has taken special aim at chains that were bought by private equity groups or hedge funds and later went bankrupt bain capital and kkr in the case of toys r us and billionaire eddie lampert in the case of sears while all toys r us stores in the us have closed lampert recently reached a deal to keep 425 sears stores open carrie gleason policy director at rise up retail said laidoff workers would be less reliant on unemployment benefits if they received a week of pay for every year theyd worked at a company she also argued that investors might be less likely to close a struggling business and more eager to rescue it if shutting the doors required paying out severance the owners of toys r us she noted rejected some offers to buy and reorganize the chain if you could imagine where someone got three months notice and then a week of severance for every year they would just about have enough of the real time it takes to find a job gleason said at chains like sears and toys r us she added many workers were midcareer or older and suddenly found themselves having to start over while facing age discrimination as for whether her group will push for severance laws beyond new jersey were already hearing from interested policymakers around the country gleason said zach herman a researcher at the national conference of state legislatures which tracks state legislation around the country said new jersey is the only state with such a proposal on the table so far this year maine he noted already has a similar severance law on the books requiring a weeks pay for each year of service in mass layoffs although only for employees with at least three years on the job several other states require severance only when the employer fails to give the legally obligated warning thats the current law in new jersey the proposal has a good chance of passing in new jersey where democrats control both chambers of the statehouse and the democratic governor phil murphy has promised progressive reforms still egenton of the state chamber of commerce said he hopes a middle ground can be reached with softer severance provisions to placate businesses he also said he wouldnt be surprised if employers fought the measure in court if it became law we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly

join us once again bruce miller said he hopes the bill passes as is he worked on commission at sears and his earnings fell late in his career as the companys business dropped off he was already facing foreclosure when he lost his job he said if hed had a weeks salary for every year he worked miller added maybe he could have worked out arrangements with his lender rather than losing his home we want to change the rules so that other people coming into this situation wont have to go through this he said

worldnews the push to legalize drug checking at music festivals in australia is gathering momentum with a new study reporting nearly 90 percent of participants said they would use such a service if it were available before taking illicit drugs drug checking at music festivals has long been called for by public health advocates and drug reform campaigners the summer music festival and party season in australia often sadly sees many drug overdoses and deaths with many of these reactions ascribed to people ingesting a substance that was sold as something else or because the drug was laced with more toxic ingredients such as detergent or rat poison during the 20162017 festival season 21 people were hospitalized after bad reactions to drugs taken at a festival one man died at a queensland festival over new years eve two men died on a party bus to a festival in sydney and three people died and 20 were hospitalized after a bad batch of ecstasy was sold on melbournes chapel street drug checking also known as pill testing has been in place at parties and music festivals throughout europe for years it has shown success in preventing deaths and injuries in the netherlands austria portugal and other countries with the service someone who wants to take a drug can come to a booth where the pill or powder can be checked scientifically to produce a detailed analysis of its ingredients festivalgoers can then make an informed decision about what they put in their body despite vigorous efforts from campaigners health experts and the federal greens party pill testing is still not permitted in australia recent studies at australian universities have indicated that young people want the services to be available and would heed warnings in a study of 642 people from western sydney university conducted at a major australian music festival in 2016 and published in the harm reduction journal more than 54 percent of respondents said they would be highly likely to use a free drug testing service at a festival another 33 percent said they would be somewhat likely to use it making a total of 87 percent saying it would be useful participants also said the results of a test would influence their decision to take that drug with 65 percent saying they would not take any substance found to contain methamphetamine and 57 percent saying they would not take a substance containing the anesthetic ketamine the idea is not to facilitate or condone drug use but to help people make better informed decisions and to provide an opportunity for harm reduction information and health promotion messages to be given directly to young people said dr jennifer johnston research fellow at the university centre for rural health north coast which was involved in the study a recent university of new south wales study involving 850 young people found that 94 percent said they would use a drug checking service at clubs or festivals in 2015 the australian institute of health and welfares national drug strategy household survey reported 27 percent of australians ages 20 to 29 had used illicit drugs in the previous 12 months australians use mdma ecstasy at a slightly higher rate than the global average according to the 2017 global drug survey and almost threequarters of australian mdma users ingest the drug in pill form the highest amount in the world the 2014 united nations world drug report found australians had the worlds highest rate of ecstasy consumption despite this a study of drug reports by american drug addiction information service project know found ecstasy available in australia is among the most dangerous in the world dr david caldicott an emergency physician and drug expert is one of those leading the charge for pill testing in australia his

program for over a decade including a trial at a south australian festival in 2005 wants to bring in the latest equipment forensic analysts supervised by doctors he says he would set up shop in a visible part of the venue asking potential drug users to bring their substance pill powder or otherwise in for a test the tests take 20 to 40 minutes for an accurate analysis this is not novel or scary or dangerous the only people portraying it as such are fringe members of the prohibition movement and politicians terrified of engaging with anything on illicit drugs he told huffpost in 2015
health we all want our children to be safe and healthy measles is a serious and highly contagious disease but fortunately we can prevent it with immunizations the measles mumps and rubella mmr vaccine is safe and the best way to protect your child against measles and other diseases i understand that some parents are concerned about vaccines the evidence about the vaccines safety and benefits is strong and consistent there is a lot of inaccurate information circulating about the measles vaccine so lets make sure we separate the facts from the myths if you have any concerns or questions talk to your childs health care provider in the meantime here are some answers to the most commonly asked questions i get how easy is it to get measles if you arent vaccinated if you arent vaccinated and you are exposed to measles you have a 90 percent chance of getting measles we know that measles is extremely contagious it spreads when an infected person breathes coughs or sneezes it spreads so easily that if one person has it nine out of 10 of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected you can get measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been even several hours after that person has left a person is infectious from four days prior to rash onset through four days after rash onset unvaccinated people put themselves and others at risk for measles and its complications if a person hasnt been vaccinated or isnt protected by virtue of having previously had a case of measles they can get measles anywhere school work gyms etc and at any time of year because they can be exposed to the disease by unvaccinated and contagious people who may have entered or returned to the us from another country thats why vaccination is so important should parents ever be worried about the vaccine if so which parents should be worried the measlesmumpsrubella mmr vaccine is very safe and it is effective at preventing measles as well as mumps and rubella vaccines like any medicine can have side effects but most children who get the mmr shot have no side effects many parents have some anxiety when it comes to health care visits including those involving vaccines however parents can be reassured by the safety record of vaccines and the fact that they provide excellent protection we take vaccine safety seriously we have strong systems that monitor vaccines before they are licensed and after they go into widespread use in addition its important to remember that vaccines can provide parents with peace of mind when it comes to a number of diseases most parents choose the safe proven protection of vaccines and are vaccinating their children according to the recommended immunization schedule thanks to vaccines very few children now contract what used to be common diseases of childhood i encourage parents to talk to their health care professionals about their vaccinerelated questions and concerns there is a great deal of conflicting and often inaccurate information circulating about vaccines so it is understandable that parents will have concerns parents may also have questions about which vaccines are being administered at a specific visit and how to recognize and manage any potential side effects i always encourage parents to raise these kinds of questions with their childrens health care providers what percentage of kids who get the mmr vaccine have a reaction most children have no side effects from the mmr vaccine the side effects that do occur are usually very mild and temporary such as a fever or rash more serious side effects are rare these may include high fever that could cause a seizure in about one person out of every 3000 who get the shot and temporary pain and stiffness in joints mostly in teens and adults as americas doctor i want our children to be safe and healthy nothing is more important than that so i can understand why parents want to be sure that vaccines are safe for their kids the evidence about the mmr vaccines safety and benefits is strong and consistent many sources like the independent institute of medicine report have confirmed that the mmr vaccine is safe the measles vaccine has been used in the united states for more than 50 years and is 9397 percent effective at preventing measles with long lasting protection because of measles vaccination we have prevented more than 156 million deaths globally since 2000 how would a parent know if they need to ask about their child getting a medical exemption i encourage all parents to talk to their doctor or health care provider about vaccinating their children for measles there are cases in which some children should delay or should not get the mmr or mmrv measles mumps rubella and varicella vaccines and your doctor will be able to help guide you you should talk to your childs doctor if your child the bottom line talk to your childs health care provider if you have any questions or concerns about vaccinations for your child when are kids supposed to get their vaccines different vaccines are recommended at different ages the recommended immunization schedule is designed to protect infants and children early in life when they are most vulnerable and before they are exposed to potentially lifethreatening diseases cdc recommends the first dose of the mmr vaccine at 12 through 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age check schedules on when to get your child vaccinated talk with your health care provider about what is best for your child including how to schedule any missed vaccinations my kids arent vaccinated and now im worried that they are at risk what do i do if my kids are late on their vaccines if your child isnt vaccinated work with your childs health care provider to determine vaccination dates for the missed or skipped vaccines although it is advised to follow the recommended vaccine schedule so that you dont leave your child vulnerable to disease there are catchup schedules for many vaccines including mmr schoolaged children and adolescents are recommended to have had two doses of mmr vaccine with at least 28 days between the two doses does it make a difference medically speaking if the vaccines are all given on the same day or are spread out over time cdc recommends the first dose of the mmr vaccine at 12 through 15 months of age and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age or at least 28 days following the first dose if a child doesnt have health insurance how do i get them the vaccine if you dont have insurance the vaccines for children vfc program may be able to help this program provides vaccines at no cost to doctors who serve eligible children children younger than 19 years of age are eligible for vfc vaccines if they

receive the mmr vaccine without any costsharing requirements when provided by an innetwork provider how long does the immunity from the mom last in an infant most infants born in the united states will receive passive protection against measles mumps and rubella in the form of antibodies from their mothers if their mother has had measles or the mmr vaccine by 12 months of age almost all infants have lost this passive protection while immunity from the mom can last for up to 12 months this varies from child to child all infants of any age are considered to be at risk for getting measles if they are exposed to the virus should i be worried about measles when i bring my infant out in public to events or to day care it depends most infants born in the united states will receive passive protection against measles mumps and rubella in the form of antibodies from their mothers though by age 12 months almost all infants will have lost this passive protection overall the us has high national vaccination coverage of roughly 92 meaning that the risk of measles transmission is low however there are pockets of people within communities where vaccination rates are lower than the national average making the risk of measles spreading in these communities higher because risk of exposure to measles depends on whether it is circulating in your community in places where measles is not currently circulating and vaccination rates are high wed generally state that it is safe for your child to go to day care day care facilities are required to report vaccination records to the state health department each year talk with your childs day care provider or check with your state health department to obtain these records i also encourage you to consult with your doctor or local health department to get their advice on the risk of measles in your community the best way to protect infants before they are able to get the vaccine is to make sure people around them are vaccinated the bottom line talk to your doctor talk to your day care and make sure your kids get vaccinated on time what percentage of the population needs the measles vaccine in order to make everyone safe preventing measles cases and outbreaks requires having as many people vaccinated as possible generally about 92 percent to 94 percent of people need to be immune to measles to protect others who cannot get vaccinated in 2013 the overall national coverage for measlesmumpsrubella mmr vaccine among children aged 1935 months was 919 percent however even with very high national vaccination coverage there can be subsets of the population that have much lower rates of vaccination rapid and early public heath responses to limit transmission particularly in communities that may have groups of people who are not vaccinated are equally critical to maintaining measles elimination the more people who are vaccinated or otherwise immune to measles the more we decrease everyones risk for getting measles however this community immunity cannot provide 100 percent protection so we recommend that everyone who can get vaccinated if a child is medically at risk and has been advised by their health care provider not to get the vaccine then how many people around them need to be vaccinated in order to keep them safe generally about 92 percent to 94 percent of people need to be immune to measles to protect others who cannot get vaccinated however the concern is that some individuals in the community are opting out of vaccination and these individuals tend to cluster in groups these groups of susceptible individuals then accumulate and age over time this in turn makes them susceptible to outbreaks when someone brings the virus into the group from abroad in 2013 the overall national coverage for measlesmumpsrubella mmr vaccine among children aged 1935 months was 919 percent but pockets of unvaccinated people can exist in states with high vaccination coverage underscoring considerable measles susceptibility at some local levels the best thing families can do to protect children who cant get vaccinated because they are too young or have a medical condition is to make sure their own vaccines are up to date whats the contagion level from kids who have recently been vaccinated i heard they shed the live virus for a while after receiving the vaccine people who receive an mmr vaccine do not shed the live measles virus measles mumps and rubella vaccine viruses are not transmitted from a vaccinated person it takes about 1014 days for your immune system to fully respond to the mmr vaccine and protect you against measles as an adult should i get another mmr vaccine people who received two doses of measles vaccine as children according to the us vaccination schedule have had measles or are born before 1957 are considered protected for life and do not need a booster dose if youre not sure whether you were vaccinated talk with your health care provider when my child goes on a playdate how should i ask the parents about whether their kids are vaccinated parents generally understand and empathize with each others concern for the safety and wellbeing of their children however we must also respect peoples privacy when it comes to health issues vaccinating your child is the best way to ensure that your own child does not get the measles after receiving the recommended twodoses of the mmr vaccine it is 97 percent effective at preventing measles your child is also at lower risk if there are no active measles cases in the community and vaccination rates are higher than 90 percent if your child cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons you may consider sharing that information with the parents of your childs playdate you can let them know that you are concerned about the risk of your child getting measles if i know parents who are not vaccinating their kids what should i say to them parents have an important role in making decisions about their childrens health you can help provide accurate scientific and public health information by referring peers to sources such as this or wwwvaccinesgov additionally the cdc has an excellent brief video of mothers talking with a pediatrician about vaccinations here you should also encourage them to talk to their own pediatrician or health care provider to answer questions they may have about vaccines how can i help increase the vaccination rates in my community the best way to help increase vaccinations rates in your community is to ensure that you and your family are vaccinated you can also support activities such as national infant immunization week niiw to help recognize the critical role vaccination plays in protecting our children communities and public health

science weve all been there thanksgiving dinner with that uncle the outspoken climatechangedenier please it was so cold this winter a phone call with an antivaxxer friend everyone knows that vaccines contain dangerous chemicals or an attempt to impress by a daughters new boyfriend but ive heard that the mammalian eye is way too complicated to have evolved by chance whats a poor scientist to do sit in miserable silence start an argument perhaps pour yourself a glass of wine or six truth be told i have tried all of those strategies and im here to tell you that they dont work very well but it is possible to engage people who reject or doubt the established scientific consensus without starting world war iii or surrendering your selfrespect its even possible to change peoples minds at least some peoples minds some of the time but more important than changing minds is acting as a respectful diplomat from the country of science weve been talking for awhile about starting a series in which ncse staff helps you navigate the tricky world of talking about science in a social setting this is important even when your audience doesnt include a skeptic all scientists need to learn how to communicate effectively with nonscientists whether science friend or potential science foe as stephanie keep pointed out in a recent post polls show that people respect scientists but they dont necessarily trust them talking about science in an engaging manner free from jargon is key to narrowing the gap between scientists and those who admire scientists but arent sure they accept specific conclusions that rub them the wrong way i was inspired to write this inaugural post when just the other week i found myself seated next to a climate skeptic at a dinner party a selfdescribed curmudgeon the gentleman in question holder of a phd in a discipline of science that shall remain nameless but feel free to speculate told me that he just wasnt sure that recent changes in climate were not part of a natural cycle and with that short teaser ill leave it to you to come up with some ideas in a few days ill tell you how the conversation actually went down

health a common problem that married couples encounter is what i call the blame game by the blame game i am referring to fights in which each spouse insists on being right and that the other is wrong weve all played the blame game at some time or other with matching mirror neurons spouses attack criticize defend and blame each other on the surface you find two strongminded people both with fixed rigid opinions and behaviors dig a little deeper and you will find two fragile people who hold onto their rightness for dear life why they both suffer from poor selfesteem indeed at the core of the blame game is a weak sense of self or poor selfesteem that is rooted in childhood the neural pathways laid down back then influence our selfesteem in adulthood to establish a strong sense of self a good parent climbs on board with the childs moods feelings thoughts mirror neurons and empathy are on track so that the child develops a strong sense of self a true self that is firmly rooted emotionally unavailable depressed anxious preoccupied hostile or controlling parents fall short in this crucial task of a childs brain development their mirror neurons misfire a parent who insists that you follow in their footsteps in terms of personality aspirations interests or proclivities is not climbing on board with you you either follow that parents lead or youre out in the cold did your parent accept you as you truly were or did that parent criticize and devalue you if you didnt conform to his or her views if so here are some scripts you may have written perhaps in your wish to please and your eagerness to conform you lost your true self in your parent in another script altogether you may have rebelled lost favor with your parent and now feel unacceptable and unworthy in either case your selfesteem built on a shaky foundation may well be tenuous in a fight with your partner you may defend your shaky selfesteem and blame and attack your partner you may fight to be right or you may give up quickly sulk and feel even more unacceptable or unworthy those with a strong sense of self are flexible and dont fear losing themselves when taking responsibility in contrast those with a fragile sense of self are rigid and unable to take responsibility they defend themselves attack and bring out the worst in their partners heated blows further weaken a brittle sense of self in the blame game where its all about proving youre right when selfworth is contingent on being right stomping on your partners selfesteem is the name of the game in this war of right and wrong a weak sense of self is further weakened and both partners wind up losing two types of trees come to mind here well rooted and nourished when a strong wind blows one tree is flexible bends to the wind and does not topple over another tree not as well rooted and nourished in the wake of a strong wind breaks and topples over the keys to relationship repair entail understanding that the brain is plastic and that new positive experience in the present can change the dynamic because a married couple is linked by mirror neurons change in one of them will create change in the other in marital therapy i work with couples to enhance their respective self esteems i have found that when one spouse begins to savor his or her own strengths the other spouse climbs on board and points out even more strengths feeling more valued the first spouse will be able to recognize the other ones strengths with mutual respect the couple is in a stronger position to listen to the other persons views to place themselves in the other persons shoes to bend and to compromise instead of blaming each other happily married loving spouses try to see their role in an argument and to take responsibility

environment i dont usually do sequels to blogs but events have moved rapidly since my first blog on speaker john boehners injecting himself into california water policy for one thing its raining here so the worst drought in the states history may become just a severe drought and californians are behaving like rural villagers in india welcoming rain not as bad weather but as a blessing and gray as the color not of tears but of happiness but that hasnt stopped boehner from summoning his caucus to pass the astonishingly boldfaced water grab by san joaquin valley republicans which would massively redistribute the states water in the favor of republican farming districts to the disadvantage of the largely democratic rest of the state the house passed the bill wednesday on a party line vote 229191 in theory of course house republicans want to keep the federal government from intruding into the proper realm of states thats their core guiding principal we are told but this bill which is opposed by a wide swathe of western governors overrides state law in a number of critical areas and undoes the historic understandings of which water users are entitled to priority in a drought its about as big a federal power grab as you can conceive of and has been scathingly denounced by house democrats from agricultural districts that would lose water like john garamendi as a theft of water from someone to give to somebody else plain and simple imagine that in their final terms in congress henry waxman and george miller were to introduce federal legislation preempting california water law and requiring the state to end the overdraft of groundwater reserves on the valid grounds that is seriously threatening the long term viability of the entire us economy because california is such a large part of what drives prosperity for the whole country a yell to rend the firmament would explode from conservative circles in washington at this egregious congressional watertheft and power grab this bill is not going to pass the house put it through once before and it died in the senate the white house has already threatened a veto but the question it raises is why is no one in the media calling boehner on his hypocrisy here is a speaker who dithered for three years to get a national farm bill on the house calendar now says he wont be able to get immigration reform done in 2014 but he can ramrod through a piece of legislation that violates every principal he and his caucus stand for except partisan payoffs it certainly looks like the national political media have internalized the fact that the house republicans play by their own set of rules and therefore shouldnt unlike chris christie or the democrats be held accountable for blatant thuggery boehner thinks this move will help his caucus in san joaquin valley districts in 2014 and he may well be right but longer term he is driving even more deeply into the california political landscape the identification of the republican party with a narrow set of economic interests the least fertile most heavily subsidy dependent farmers and the oil industry a veteran leader in the environmental movement carl pope spent the last 18 years of his career at the sierra club as ceo and chairman hes now the principal advisor at inside straight strategies looking for the underlying economics that link sustainability and economic development mr pope is coauthor along with paul rauber of strategic ignorance why the bush administration is recklessly destroying a century of environmental progress which the new york review of books called a splendidly fierce book

economy after four months of working for the small management consulting firm red associates in new york city funke sangodeyi felt like something was off sangodeyi who has a bachelors degree and a phd from harvard and a masters from cambridge was at a company retreat in the spring of 2015 there were workshops and teambuilding exercises typical of such gatherings the setting was posh the south of france a couple of hours outside nice recalled sangodeyi who is nigerian american and in her early 40s then at a party one night at a villa overlooking the lush countryside a senior manager a white man approached her oh my god your skin is so dark sangodeyi recalled him saying does it come in shades darker than yours she was shocked you dont say that she told him its a bizarre thing to say that was just the start of a disturbing few years for sangodeyi at red associates a management consulting firm based in copenhagen and new york city that currently has 51 employees red is small compared to competitors like mckinsey but not insignificant its clients have included global giants such as lego facebook google samsung and the ford motor company red is also partly owned by cognizant a multibilliondollar publicly traded global tech consultancy like many consulting firms red markets itself as an elite group that offers brilliant insights but a close look at the firm raises questions about what elite actually means huffpost spoke with 11 former employees and others close to the firm a mix of white and nonwhite men and women nine requested anonymity fearing reprisals from the firm together they paint a picture of a company led by mostly white partners some of whom appear to view themselves as superior to people of other races nationalities and classes partners mocked the accents and appearance of indian colleagues characterized black female employees as angry and scary and used stereotypes about chinese people while doing work for clients in that country class distinctions were particularly fraught one former employee says she was mocked for the brand of tea she drank comments like these are of course completely inappropriate and wrong the company said in a statement to huffpost they do not reflect the culture of red where we value diversity of thought and experience these kinds of views seeped into the firms work when one partner became obsessed with the bell curve the widely discredited 1994 book that tries to link iq and race and pushed to research inherited intelligence for a prospective pitch to the lego foundation the research never made it to the company reds story is not unusual corporate america likes to broadcast its commitment to diversity but isnt exactly known as welcoming for people of color a minuscule percentage of corporate leaders are black in a 2018 survey 58 of workers of color said theyre always or often on guard against racist comments and behaviors outright racist comments microaggressions and mistreatment are not uncommon and little is done about it the federal agency handling race discrimination complaints gets at least 100000 each year but most go nowhere as nationwide protests over police brutality and systemic racism swept the country this summer companies around the world doubled down on promises to diversify their offices red associates was no different the firm posted on linkedin declaring black lives matter and decrying systemic racism current and former employees were stunned at the hypocrisy the post prompted sangodeyi to reach out to huffpost red told huffpost that it cares deeply about racial justice and employs people with diverse backgrounds we are continually striving to build an ever more diverse collective of thinkers in particular through the addition of more black voices the firm said most of the leaders listed on the firms website are white in recent years red has hired people of color at the entry level particularly as some clients and junior staff complained about the lack of diversity but those new hires have mostly left and many felt beaten down isolated and repelled by the culture at least 13 people of color including all of the firms black female employees have either quit or say they were pushed out over the past two years some close to the firm wonder if it could ever truly diversify the people who ran the company had a very narrow understanding of what it means to be elite valuable and successful and that was always being a white man said luke johnson 26 who worked as a consultant at the firm from 2017 to 2018 eliot brown a partner at the firm who describes himself as mixed black trinidadian and british said he was surprised to hear that others werent comfortable at red he has worked there since 2008 i believe that these people experienced what they claimed to experience but its a long way away from what i and many other people of color ive known at red have experienced he told huffpost the whole thing is really upsetting to me because of that i feel like a place that should at least be given a break for trying and possibly even celebrated for getting it right is being depicted as a place that intentionally got it so wrong it feels unfair the firms current managing partner millie arora is not white and she told huffpost that she realizes the firm can do better at diversity as an indian american woman as managing partner it is one of my key priorities its something we continuously want to do better at she said recent events have prompted a lot more introspection former employees and others close to the firm said its culture is exemplified by cofounder christian madsbjerg a danish man who has lived in new york city for years he teaches at the new school and has written for the financial times the wall street journal and quartz johnson called madsbjerg a notorious elitist who is very much against what he perceives as political correctness an attitude that prevails at the firm johnson laid out why he was leaving red in a 2018 email pointing to remarks madsbjerg made that he believed were troubling in the email reviewed by huffpost johnson said hed just heard madsbjerg make a seemingly offhand seemingly joking remark about how france and germany are the only places where theres any civilization left madsbjerg made the remark to a female partner at the firm and a new hire a woman of color as well as to johnson he wrote he said they laughed awkwardly oh just ignore the crazy old dane the clearly uncomfortable partner told the new consultant according to johnsons email but christian persisted he wrote insisting that it wasnt just a jokethat he did indeed believe that theres a small triangular region situated of course in europe where the only real valuable cultural and historical progress has happened as an afterthought madsbjerg said japan is included in this group johnson wrote he also wrote that hed heard madsbjerg say of hollywood producer harvey weinstein nobody would have complained about weinstein if he were attractive weinstein was convicted of rape in 2020 in the email johnson said comments like these were part of the reason he was leaving the company earlier than planned to go to graduate school those kinds of remarks made red a hostile place for people who are not straight white men and could also turn off prospective clients he wrote in a long statement to huffpost madsbjerg insisted he was passionate about diversity i never in my wildest dreams thought that one day i would have to ward off allegations of bigotry he said emphasizing that his wife is muslim and that he converted to islam he also said he moved to the us from denmark to escape bigotry i am perplexed and hurt by it he added it is just not who i am at the height of the controversy one consultant threw a copy of the bell curve in the trash in front of his colleagues and poured ranch dressing over it according to one former employee madsbjerg assigned one of the firms entrylevel consultants to write up a research proposal citing murrays work former employees said he was particularly interested in the notion that intelligence is inherited the consultant wrote in notes titled quick overview of what christian asked that were shared with others at the firm at the time and have since been obtained by huffpost in another document the consultant prepared more detailed notes and research about what he said he and madsbjerg discussed task write a 1 page memo to lego foundation convincing them to commit their time and money to promoting learningdevelopment among the stupid state the notes also obtained by huffpost in a section titled overview in a list titled find informationfigures christian mentioned regarding the consultant included the bell curve racial correlation and coveruprepression why it isnt popular in society today deeper into the document the consultant wrote private note to christian were putting ourselves out on a limb here it wouldnt take much digging to find wellstructured empiricallyreviewed studies that undermine the heritability of intelligence he then listed some citations such a proposal is typically a first step in putting together a client pitch and the consultant ultimately wrote a draft memo titled acknowledging hard truths to discover new solutions the memo addressed to the ceo of the lego foundation and obtained by huffpost argues researchers have for years ignored the inconvenient truth that intelligence is passed down genetically and social factors are less significant it proposed that the lego foundation needed to acknowledge this in order to truly help children lego has long been a client of red but the lego foundation did not ask for the research red associates told huffpost in a statement the lego foundation confirmed that it had never asked for this material nor seen the memo the consultants source materials delved into race and intelligence but the draft memo huffpost saw doesnt explicitly mention race still its the unavoidable subtext whenever the subject of heritable intelligence comes up said kathryn paige harden a behavioral geneticist and a professor of psychology at the university of texas at austin anyone who talks about the bell curve without addressing race it feels like a dog whistle to me said harden who reviewed the draft memo for huffpost younger staff members at red and a number of people of color at the company aware of the yearslong controversy surrounding murrays work spoke out against the research at the height of the controversy one consultant threw a copy of the bell curve in the trash in front of his colleagues and poured ranch dressing over it according to one former employee sangodeyi said she recalled a conversation with madsbjerg at the time in which she told him that debates around iq are racially charged in the us and that the whole thing was extremely dicey to venture into in a statement madsbjerg said that he had little to do with the research and that hed never seen the memo until huffpost asked about it as for the bell curve he said in the statement i didnt even know what it was until it was brought to my attention as part of general research conducted by a new consultant at red about how job automation and job loss might be predicted in denmark the debate about intelligence is not about race or ethnicity at all he said i find even the suggestion that there is any connection between race and intelligence repulsive but also simply untrue red also blamed the consultant who was tasked with writing the memo this research was conducted by a staff person in an effort to understand the correlation between employment and iq after the research was complete and synthesized in a memo it was dismissed as without merit the company said emphasizing that the research was never shared outside the firm and that red has never used it in any way but former employees said madsbjerg initiated the research i felt bad for the guy tasked with writing it said one former employee familiar with the project these were not his views at all this was not a consultant gone rogue instructions came from higher up madsbjerg is no longer running the firm day to day but he sits on its board and brings in business from prominent clients he told huffpost he takes full responsibility for the firms culture from the beginning i wanted a global culture and i have tried to make sure that we transformed from a danish to a global generous culture the best we could he said this was important to me for business reasons but also because it reflects my personal values madsbjerg is set to teach a course at the new school this fall called human observation true observation is the ability to look and listen without the interference of assumptions and prejudices reads the course description found online only white authors are listed in the description although no one huffpost spoke to alleges that madsbjerg made overtly racist statements to employees other partners and managers have been heard making comments about black people as well as about their counterparts within cognizant that company which bought a 49 stake in red in 2016 has a big presence in india at a 2018 meeting a top partner at red described an indian colleague at cognizant as looking like apu from the simpsons and laughed to himself according to contemporaneous notes a former employee shared with huffpost it wasnt unusual for partners to mock indian accents several former employees said or to look down on cognizant employees more generally there was a dismissiveness to the value of cognizants math and science expertise sangodeyi said partners at red would say that they needed to teach their counterparts at cognizant how to think johnson said they didnt think of people of color as their equals or worthy enough to be accepted into the doors of red brown was one of the people to put on an indian accent some employees of color were offended by this according to a former red employee brown said he meant it in fun i do all sorts of accents at work and in life i do posh english people danish people trinidadian family my london family and yeah i do indian accents im quite good at accents he said i wouldve hoped that people wouldve realized that i meant no malice by it india is one of my favorite countries on the planet i lived there for six months i get on well with my indian colleagues at cognizant and celebrate them sincerely id hope all that considered people would realize i meant not to belittle by doing an accent ethnic stereotyping wasnt confined to indian people if a client was trying to understand the chinese consumer partners would at times fall back on certain orientalist cliches using words like inscrutable and characterizing chinese people as mysterious said one former employee another former employee a 29yearold woman with an indigenous background recalled bringing twining tea to the office she said one of her male colleagues told her it was proletariat tea as though the brand wasnt fancy enough she said she never felt like she fit in at the firm i dont want to call them all racists thats not true she said but they didnt think of people of color as their equals or worthy enough to be accepted into the doors of red sangodeyi takes care to point out that there were a lot of good people at the firm but said things could get uncomfortable with the most senior managers and partners i told the hr person when i left theres just something off about this place she said in 2015 after the incident in the south of france sangodeyi wanted to give the firm the benefit of the doubt she was new to the company perhaps the comment was coming from a place of ignorance since the manager was from a more provincial part of denmark she thought many partners and managers at red which was founded in copenhagen are danish including the man who made the remark denmark is relatively small and homogenous possibly a dynamic at play here is that red is a global company founded on nonamerican not exclusively american dynamics brown said one of the challenges at red will be bridging the cultural divide said mathew yazzie a san franciscobased diversity consultant red hired yazzie who has worked on diversity issues at google and for other silicon valley firms said he didnt think red was that unusual i wasnt surprised by a lot of it he said ive seen everything he plans to do a diversity audit in the coming weeks looking at the firms processes such as hiring and performance reviews in a statement to huffpost red associates claimed that the man who exclaimed about sangodeyis skin color made an immediate and deeply sincere apology sangodeyi said that was absolutely not true and that the man just walked away after she told him his remarks were bizarre she said she was mainly happy daytoday working at the company but that her time at red associates was marked by these kinds of offputting moments there was the time she was at the daily communal lunch where everyone stands and shares a meal around a tall white table in the companys meeting room flowers are usually on display too always white sangodeyi was eating with a group of colleagues when a white female partner started talking about the term negro she said its like why are you talking about this she recalled thinking she walked out sangodeyi is a historian of science by training she grew up in the suburbs went to a private school spent years at harvard im used to being in white spaces and not being bothered by microaggressions she said this felt different partners at the firm also called her angry or difficult both to her face and to others within the firm even after sangodeyi pointed out to her managers that such characterizations were steeped in stereotypes former colleagues told huffpost neither term applied even remotely to sangodeyi comments like these could help explain why women of color didnt seem to advance at the company women of color took nearly four times as long as white men to get promoted to manager according to an analysis that was created by a consultant at red in 2018 some men led only one project or no projects before getting promoted according to the spreadsheet obtained by huffpost two white women were promoted after leading a single project no women of color were sangodeyi led five projects over her nearly four years at the company without being promoted she left the firm two years ago frustrated after watching less experienced less credentialed male colleagues be promoted to manager while she was skipped over because she wasnt ready red associates said it cant comment on individual employees but it did say yazzie will develop a training program to make sure everyone understands microaggressions and why they are racist and harmful to their colleagues and to the overall culture of a workplace in june red associates declared on linkedin that black lives matter and condemned systemic racism we want to see change and we need to move beyond social media statements inequity is only addressed through long term sustained efforts at the root of the social and racial issues read the post the firm also seemed to acknowledge its own shortcomings we also have much to interrogate and so much we can and must do better said the post if you have thoughts or resources to share experts you recommend we learn from or partner with please comment or email us the fact that no one internally can act as a thought leader on these issues demonstrates the types of people who are valued internally current and former employees were outraged it seemed tone deaf given the lack of diversity to say we stand with this movement said one person who is close to the company and familiar with the recent turmoil noting it also seemed like red was soliciting free advice from people of color it should be something the company should be actively seeking out and paying for leaders at red should look inward wrote nelson saldana a former consultant who left the firm this spring in a comment on the linkedin post the fact that no one internally can act as a thought leader on these issues demonstrates the types of people who are valued internally that comment has since been deleted and saldana did not respond to huffposts request for further comment inside the company the linkedin post prompted consultants and partners to have an open conversation about diversity on a conference call one consultant a person of color who already had a foot out the door talked about how they had always felt uncomfortable at red and never felt ok speaking up according to someone familiar with the call arora the managing partner also sent out emails to staff in early june acknowledging the firm needed to do more we are a small company who values inclusion and diversity of ideas and perspective yet we dont have enough diversity on our team have struggled to retain people of color and i worry that means our culture hasnt felt as welcoming to all as it should she wrote sangodeyi left the firm in 2018 fed up with its casual racism implicit and explicit bias and with the inequities in promotion she said she founded her own consulting company last year about 13 people of color including four black women have left the firm since then according to those familiar with the firms numbers some quit others were laid off after a recent bout of downsizing one of the black women who left said working at red associates was a painful experience this woman who was relatively new to the firm and young said her manager called her scary during a 2018 meeting with a client at which she was presenting she said she complained about this to him and finally to another senior manager but nothing happened in fact she said her manager was promoted the remarks the way the incident was handled and the feelings of otherness wore her down after a while those things make you question your voice your team the trust of the people you work around she told huffpost red said these comments were completely inappropriate and wrong its not unusual for people of color working in the corporate world to wind up questioning themselves and those around them said dnika travis lead researcher at catalyst a nonprofit that advocates for diversity inclusion and equality in the workplace travis who is black has been interviewing women and men of color about their experiences for years the comments the slights and insults amount to what travis calls an emotional tax women and men of color pay the tax with their very souls the stories are harrowing and heartbreaking travis said the black employee who was called scary by her manager said she felt like she shut down after that that shutting down let me be less creative at work she said id stop speaking up as much in meetings id stop speaking up as much in group sessions i felt invalidated like i didnt matter

environment oslo reuters pesticides used in farming are also killing worker bumblebees and damaging their ability to gather food meaning colonies that are vital for plant pollination are more likely to fail when they are used a study showed on sunday the united nations has estimated that a third of all plantbased foods eaten by people depend on bee pollination and scientists have been baffled by plummeting numbers of bees mainly in north america and europe in recent years british scientists said they exposed colonies of 40 bumblebees which are bigger than the more common honeybee to the pesticides neonicotinoid and pyrethroid over four weeks at levels similar to those in fields neonicotinoids are nicotinelike chemicals used to protect various crops from locusts aphids and other pests chronic exposure impairs natural foraging behavior and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success the scientists wrote in the report in the journal nature on sunday exposure to a combination of the two pesticides increases the propensity of colonies to fail according to the researchers at royal holloway university of london a 2011 un report estimated that bees and other pollinators such as butterflies beetles or birds do work worth 153 billion euros 200 billion a year to the human economy and are in decline in many nations the findings underscored the importance of wider testing of pesticides to ensure they do not also target bees it said france banned a neonicotinoid pesticide made by swiss agrochemicals group syngenta in june citing evidence of a threat to the countrys bees a report last month however said that the original research was flawed my guess is that the decline of bees is like a jigsaw there are probably a lot of pieces to put into place this is probably a very important piece of that jigsaw lead author richard gill told reuters of the findings about pesticides in a separate commentary in nature juliet osborne of the university of exeter in england said the study underscored the need to understand all factors that may contribute to harm bees and to colony collapse disorder for example we have as yet no convincing demonstration of the relative effects of pesticides on bee colonies compared to the effects of parasites pathogens and foraging resources she wrote gill endorsed recommendations by the european food safety authority for longer testing on adult bees and larvae new ways of assessing cumulative exposure to toxins and separate assessments for different bee species he said previous studies had mostly examined the impact of pesticides on individual bees rather than colonies bumblebees form colonies of a few dozen bees while honeybees can number up to tens of thousands effects at the individual level can have a major knockon effect at the colony level thats the novelty of the study he said the average number of bees lost in the experiment both dead in the nesting box and failing to return was about twothirds of the total for bees exposed to a combination of the two pesticides against a third for a control exposed to neither we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again bumblebees exposed to a combination of pesticides were about half as successful at gathering pollen used as food compared to a control they also devoted more workers to collecting food meaning fewer were raising larvae other experts said more research was needed it certainly wouldnt be fair to say that this research spells doom for wild bees said james cresswell of the university of exeter

science a dense cloud of gas 50 million lightyears away has astronomers buzzing and theyre using all sorts of strange metaphors to get the rest of us to pay attention theyve discovered what they think may be a globular cluster a big ball of up to one million stars on the verge of being born this remarkable object looks like it was plucked straight out of the very early universe dr kelsey johnson an astronomer at the university of virginia in charlottesville and lead author on a paper about the research said in a written statement to discover something that has all the characteristics of a globular cluster yet has not begun making stars is like finding a dinosaur egg thats about to hatch story continues below images the antennae galaxies shown in visible light in a hubble image upper image were studied with alma revealing extensive clouds of molecular gas center right image one cloud bottom image is incredibly dense and massive yet apparently star free suggesting it is the first example of a prenatal globular cluster ever identified alma image of dense cores of molecular gas in the antennae galaxies the round yellow object near the center may be the first prenatal example of a globular cluster ever identified it is surrounded by a giant molecular cloud johnson and her colleagues spotted the bizarre object which they call the firecracker using the atacama large millimetersubmillimeter array alma in the atacama desert in chile its located inside a pair of interacting galaxies known to scientists as ngc 4038ngc 4039 or the antennae galaxies the firecracker has a mass thats 50 times that of our sun and is under an enormous amount of pressure roughly 10000 times greater than the average pressure in interstellar space according to the researchers this makes it a good candidate for collapsing into a globular cluster within the next million years what do other scientists make of the discovery dr alison peck alma scientist at the national radio astronomy observatory who was not involved in the new research called it important and said she was really excited to hear about these results we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again she told the huffington post in an email one of the things that we all yearn to understand is how our surroundings formed how our galaxy and our solar system came to be to do this since we cant actually watch things change over time it just takes too long we need to find similar objects at different stages of development and compare them what dr johnsons team have found here is an analog of an object that we look for in the very early universe but theyve found it so close by that well be able to make extremely detailed observations and find out much more about the physical conditions in this exciting region the research is set to be published in the astrophysical journal a preprint version of the article can be viewed here

environment from mother nature networks ramon gonzalez it used to be that if you wanted to identify the flora and fauna in your surroundings you had to study for years or carry burdensome tomes with you everywhere you went today with the help of smartphone apps anyone can identify birds bugs plants and trees with just a few swipes of a touchscreen but will this technology endanger the natural world as it makes us more familiar with it recently a birdsong app has ruffled the feathers of conservationists in england the dorset wildlife trust reported that visitors to brownsea island were using apps that imitate birdsongs in an effort to lure the creatures out so they could be photographed tony whitehead public affairs officer for the rspb europes largest conservation charity told the bbc repeatedly playing a recording of birdsong or calls to encourage a bird to respond in order to see it or photograph it can divert a territorial bird from other important duties such as feeding its young ispiny developers of birding apps for ios devices told the bbc that they welcomed a discussion on the ethics of using recorded birdsongs maybe we need to ban cellphones from nature preserves like some movie theaters ban the texting and making phone calls during movies the cornell guide to bird sounds master set for north america features 4938 cuts representing nine decades of work by more than 300 sound recordists researchers and archivists who have attempted to record the sound repertoires of 735 bird species that regularly breed in north america the master set is part of the lab of ornithologys mission to educate the public about birds and conservation i reached out to the director of the cornell lab of ornithology macaulay library dr mike webster for his take on the use of birdsong recordings and apps in the field responsible use of birding and birdsong apps likely has minimal harm to most birds the key here though is responsible use he writes like many things apps like these can be abused if people are not careful or do not know about the potential negative impacts all of the labs sound collections come with a warning recommending that playback be used sparingly and that playback during nesting should be avoided completely there are other sounds like bird alarm calls that should only be played with permission and for scientific study webster says most users of bird sounds and apps do not use them with the intent to cause harm to birds most birders are nature lovers and most are responsible they dont want to cause harm to the animals that they love illustrated bird guides opened up bird watching to people who would never have had the opportunity to learn about and interact with birds smartphone birding apps are just the natural evolution of illustrated guides and for the most part they are a positive influence the key to protecting birds and our planet for that matter is to get people engaged and get them to care about the nature says webster educational tools that are engaging and that help people understand and enjoy nature are an excellent way to do just that to their credit ispiny developers recently updated their facebook page to note that they would be updating the app description to include a suggestion not to play sounds that attract birds that are rare or those that are in breeding season hilary wilson who oversees the chirp app for ispiny shares some background information that may put things into perspective in our email exchange she said the controversy hatched when two bird photographers used a recording of a nightjar a rare nocturnal bird to entice the bird out during the day so that it could be photographed the nature reserve was understandably horrified and soon banned the use of mobile devices on the reserve we have been discussing the appropriateness of playing recorded birdsongs in the field since cassette tapes were a novelty writes paul baicich alas today it is even easier to access and play bird recordings in the field it is too easy too tempting baicich a birder since he was a teen is coauthor of a guide to the nests eggs and nestlings of north american birds and is the webmaster of great birding projects the situation in the uk is different from the situation in the usa more birders per capita fewer places to bird and resulting in more crowding in the uk this alignment of factors can lead to problems as discussed for baicich the hoi polloi descending on nature with a smartphone app that plays sounds isnt the biggest threat that endangered birds and the hobby of birding in america are facing were simply too white and we birders simply dont look enough like the rest of the country baicich said in an email exchange without extra efforts to bring the joys of the outdoors to latinos africanamericans and other minorities which will add up to be majorities in many states shortly the future of birding is not good the pastime will marginalize itself and the

technology the silliest social media apps can be the most powerful case in point a nowdefunct facebook graffiti app that started at least one couples romantic journey eight years ago kira silver and jesse corinella are professional artists who live in brooklyn new york they knew each other in high school tried the adolescent dating thing but as these things so often go in the age of sats and video games the relationship fizzled a couple of years later the two were at different colleges and staying in touch via facebook in 2007 the graffiti app came out allowing people to draw things and post them on their friends walls i sent him the atomic jellyfish first silver recalled in an email to the huffington post the atomic jellyfish is not very romantic being a hydrozoan creature experiencing with some dissatisfaction the fallout of a nuclear bombing but it started something silver and corinella began sending illustrations back and forth to one another using facebook graffiti while nothing came of their puppy love in high school using this app after they went away to college broke the ice when they finally met again in person well things got real we spent that night catching up with our friends and once the night was done i drove kira back to her parents house corinella told huffpost we stayed in the car chatting well into the predawn hours after sharing a really shy kiss we said our goodbyes and were immediately smitten with one another by shy kiss jesse means we made out hardcore in front of my parents house silver corrected ill pause here to offer a disclosure im friends with corinella and silver im working on a comic book with corinella so i knew they were talented but i couldnt believe my eyes when they showed me a trove of old graffiti sketches theyd taken screenshots of and saved years ago this was the app i had used to draw like crude pooping butts to send to my dumb friends in college and theyd used it to brilliantly convey companionship warmth and humor in the spirit of valentines day it reminded me that even the most minor exchanges can impact and shape your life in unexpected ways yes thats a vomit blast of a cliche but its true a drawing app on facebook is in a sense directly responsible for two human beings discovering that they love each other itd be enough if their story stopped at making out hardcore but theyve been together for eight years and have a cute succulentfilled home together in new york city you can see what made facebook graffiti kind of remarkable if you were really dedicated you could create some pretty impressive work but it encouraged a casual conversational tone since you were kicking drawings back and forth like chat messages silver worried about finals corinella said he was going to play wii there was nothing super serious about any of it you can see how the platform was conducive to flirting eventually facebook overhauled its design and deemphasized apps many still exist but graffiti folded years ago pointing users instead to an archive website where you can view some of the best art ever made on the platform facebook declined to comment on the app when i reached out about it last week before graffiti was shuttered though silver and corinella became artistic pen pals sending each other art and mix cds in addition to the facebook doodles by christmas wed begun a longdistance relationship between delaware and ohio corinella explained in order to keep in touch we would send one another artwork be it digital or analog so a takeaway for the lovelorn you never know when that snapchat or tweet or status update might be the start of something really really good even if theyre kind of dumb heck especially if theyre kind of dumb

technology reddit cofounder and ceo steve huffman is under fire after admitting that he personally edited comments users posted about him huffman whose username is uspez apologized thursday in the donald trump fan subreddit rthedonald for editing comments that were critical of him huffman said that in an unspecified number of user comments he replaced references to uspez with the usernames of moderators for rthedonald pizzagate refers to a debunked conspiracy theory claiming among other things that hillary clinton ran a childtrafficking ring out of a washington dc pizza place the pizza place is real the rest of the story is fabricated reddit shut down rpizzagate a forum devoted to discussing the conspiracy earlier this week some users took to rthedonald to express their displeasure with the decision and by extension with huffman the ceos confession means that when some users made disparaging comments about him using his username he replaced his username with one belonging to a moderator for the group for example an archived version of the site shows that a comment saying fuck uspez was changed to fuck utrumpshaker according to huffmans post the change only lasted for an hour and all changes have since been corrected unsurprisingly many reddit users were not happy to learn that the companys ceo was personally editing their content some called it unethical and said that it could put the integrity of any content posted to reddit into question legal site associates mind speculated that huffmans actions could create serious repercussions in terms of how reddit is treated under the law potentially the site argued huffman opened reddit to liability by transforming the site from an intermediary that hosts thirdparty comments to a site whose owners exercise editorial control over those comments the author used the example of a college billboard where students can post whatever they want as an analogy think of it like a billboard at a local college the college puts a billboard up for students to make community announcements the college never uses it then adam writes something defamatory and false about betsy betsy is upset and sues adam and the college a court would allow the lawsuit to proceed against adam but not the college because they just provided the platform and had nothing to do with the comments but the college would be liable if college staff erased adams comments and changed them to something else if adam was originally saying something mild about betsy and instead a college staffer changed it to something defamatory thats not on adam its on the college reddit did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the huffington post

economy beijingwashington april 6 reuters china warned on friday it would fight back at any cost with fresh trade measures if the united states continues on its path of protectionism hours after president donald trump threatened to slap tariffs on an additional 100 billion in chinese goods trump said the united states has already lost any trade war as he defended his proposed tariffs saying the move might cause a little pain but the united states will be better off in the long run weve already lost the trade war we dont have a trade war weve lost the trade war trumpsaid in a radio interview with new york radio show 77 wabcs bernie sid early on friday in a twitter message on wednesday he had said that war was lost many years ago by the foolish or incompetent people who represented the us chinas commerce ministry was due to hold a media briefing at 1200 gmt on friday in light of chinas unfair retaliation against earlier us trade actions trump upped the ante on thursday by ordering us officials to identify extra tariffs escalating a high stakes titfortat confrontation with potentially damaging consequences for the worlds two biggest economies on wednesday china unveiled a list of 106 us goods from soybeans and whiskey to frozen beef and aircraft targeted for tariffs in a swift retaliatory move only hours after the trump administration proposed duties on some 1300 chinese industrial technology transport and medical products washington has called for the 50 billion in extra duties after it said a probe determined chinese government policies are designed to transfer us intellectual property to chinese companies and allow them to seize leadership in key hightechnology industries of the future responding to trumps latest comments the chinese commerce ministry reiterated that chinawas not afraid of a trade war even though it did not seek one and accused the united states of provoking the conflict if the united states disregards the objections of china and the international community and persists in unilateralism and trade protectionism the chinese side will follow through to the end at any cost and definitely fight back resolutely a spokesperson was quoted as saying in a statement on the ministrys website the ministry has called for a media briefing on friday night in an unusual move on a public holiday earlier in the day chinese state media had slammed trumps threat of more trade action as ridiculous this latest intimidation reflects the deep arrogance of some american elites in their attitude towards china the staterun global times said in an editorial while beijings claims that washington is the aggressor and is spurring global protectionism chinas trading partners have complained for years that it abuses world trade organization rules and propagates unfair policies at home that lock foreign firms out of some sectors as domestic champions are being nurtured china has repeatedly vowed that it would open up sectors such as financial services president xi jinping next week is expected to unveil fresh measures on reform and his countrys opening up at the highprofile boao forum chinas

been swift to respond to washingtons rhetoric and actions so far us information technology products from mobile phones to personal computers have largely escaped the ire of beijing as well as telecoms equipment and aircraft larger than the equivalent of a boeing 737 among the most affected by a trade war could be the us technology sector particularly chipmakers the us semiconductor sector relies on china for about a quarter of its revenue it also remains to be seen if the trade dispute would trigger a nationalistic travel backlash when ties between beijing and seoul chilled chinese tourism to

economy when a poor person steals from the rich mick mulvaney calls it a crime when the rich steal from the poor he calls it capitalism on wednesday the white house budget director appeared before the house financial services committee to deliver the semiannual report of the consumer financial protection bureau of which he is also the acting head and to dispel rumors that he might run to replace rep paul ryan rwis as speaker of the house mick mulvaney is a busy man or maybe not a day before the hearing the associated press reported that the cfpb has not taken a single enforcement action against any financial institution during the six months mulvaney has been at the helm under his predecessor richard cordray the agency issued two to four fines and settlements per month the cfpb has jurisdiction over payday lenders banks credit unions and just about any institution involved in extending credit to american families the apparent improvement in corporate behavior beginning in november struck democrats on the committee as an extraordinary coincidence are you telling me that every single financial institution in america has suddenly snapped into full compliance with every single consumer financial law since you took over demanded an incredulous rep carolyn maloney dny mulvaney explained that the cfpb is still litigating 25 cases cordray brought to court i have not burned the place down that the prior director had been able to walk and chew gum simultaneously was not lost on anyone during other rounds of questioning mulvaney emphasized that he is helping the bureau focus on more quantitative analysis in its work and hopes for more guidance from congress on the meaning of the words abusive deceptive and material for help in writing and enforcing regulations when he accepted the job mulvaney said that president donald trump had told him to fix the cfpb and get it back to the point where it can protect people without trampling on capitalism in his written statement wednesday he informed congress he had developed new strategic priorities including an imperative to recognize free markets and take a prudent consistent and humble approach to enforcing the law no one will accuse him of inconsistency it was appropriate for mulvaney to be defending his record on the day ryan announced he would not run for reelection in november both men began their careers in washington as leading lights of a younger generation of libertarianleaning republicans ferociously opposed to government spending and the regulatory state birthed by franklin delano roosevelts new deal in the name of freedom capitalism and competition they hoped to slash programs for the poor and taxes for the rich singing praises to the rule of law over the rule of men and yet both politicians have achieved their greatest purpose as agents of trump dutifully pressing ahead with narrow priorities while ignoring concerns about every element of their leaders program that should have frightened smallgovernment advocates epic military spending violent deportations russian electionmeddling and a soft spot for white nationalism their careers illustrate what the libertarian political project in america has become an unprincipled protection racket for the rich ryan delivered them a smashing tax cut while mulvaney ensures that gardenvariety predation goes uncorrected the cfpb is charged with monitoring markets and writing new regulations where necessary but its primary purpose is to guard against simple theft during his tenure as director cordray returned 12 billion in illgotten gains from financial firms to american households much of it from undisclosed fees unauthorized withdrawals and similar behavior that people who did not go to law school refer to as theft for this congressional republicans did their best to convert him into a national pariah and the cfpbs semiannual report to congress became an exercise in ritualized paranoia last year rep sean duffy rwis assailed cordray for racism sexism intimidation and retaliation as republicans took turns shouting down and denouncing cordray in a spectacle described by the notoriously radical american banker trade newspaper as an onslaught during which cordray was often denied the ability to respond rep patrick mchenry rnc suggested cordrays agency had aided insider trading while rep ann wagner rmo declared that cordray had somehow fallen down on the job by exposing the fake accounts scandal at wells fargo and fining the bank 100 million on wednesday republicans could not quite give up the tradition even with one of their own in the hot seat rep andy barr rky denounced cordray for conspiring against our men and women in uniform while committee chairman jeb hensarling rtexas declared the cfpb the single most powerful and unaccountable agency in the history of the republic few people remember the day the united states senate confirmed richard cordray as the day american liberty died and so hensarling had to invoke a few hypothetical outrages to get the thin crowds blood moving the cfpbs budget is derived from the federal reserve rather than through the congressional appropriations process what would happen if the cfpb approved millions of dollars to outbid att for the naming rights to the dallas cowboys stadium what if the cfpb sent a tshirt to every man woman and child in the united states a solemn mulvaney said that no one could stop him from engaging in such despotism if he so chose hensarling found the situation borderline insane and it

again even a congressional oversight hearing for the agency did not really count as oversight mulvaney repeatedly insisted that the 2010 doddfrank law that created the cfpb did not require him to answer questions or testify before congress only to appear hensarling agreed that this was a matter of very grave concern but the gop dropped the affair after rep stephen lynch dmass pointed out the exact same language is used in the federal reserve act to compel the fed chairmans regular reports to congress and yet despite the habitually apocalyptic rhetoric from republicans it will likely be democrats who deliver the most serious lasting damage to the cfpb under trump in march the senate passed a bank deregulation package that would among other things help banks hide racial discrimination in the mortgage market undermine consumer protections for mobile home loans and eliminate a host of predatory lending standards for smaller banks the bill was crafted by senate republicans and four democrats sens mark warner dva heidi heitkamp dnd jon tester dmont and joe donnelly dind who distributed a breathtakingly dishonest myth vs fact sheet to drum up support ultimately 17 democrats voted for the bill including the partys 2016 vice presidential candidate tim kaine dva unless the republicancontrolled house completely loses its collective mind the bill will be signed into law by president trump the libertarian movement within the republican party is dead american democracy doesnt look much healthier

economy facebook isnt typically shy about proclaiming its support for women after all chief operating officer and lean in author sheryl sandberg built her brand on feminism last year the tech giant even took the rare step of publicizing its own rules and practices on sexual harassment but on one critical policy facebook is awfully wishywashy forced arbitration facebook is one of many companies that requires employees to take legal disputes like discrimination or wage claims to private courtrooms the process has come under fire for its role in silencing victims of sexual harassment especially in the wake of the me too movement in a series of conversations with huffpost over the past few weeks facebook representatives took part in a strange dance they defended the companys use of forced arbitration but also said facebook was considering its position on a bipartisan bill that would make forced arbitration illegal in sexual harassment cases were studying it and havent taken a position a facebook spokesman told huffpost adult film actress stephanie clifford also known as stormy daniels put arbitration back in the headlines this month after an arbitrator ordered her to stay silent about her alleged affair with president donald trump the arbitration process facebook uses is very official and appropriate a spokeswoman told huffpost she pointed out that although the social networking giant uses arbitration it doesnt require that participants keep silent as other employers often do huffpost could find no evidence of any employee speaking publicly about litigation against the company arbitration is good for employees because matters are kept private she said she also argued that arbitration is a neutral practice pointing out that the company and its accuser both have a say in which judge they use she emphasized that facebook takes harassment seriously and has an indepth training process for employees our philosophy is to prevent these claims in the first place she said in a statement issued on wednesday hours after huffpost published this story the companys head of employment law heidi swartz wrote facebook does not use secret courts to handle sexual harassment cases as alleged by huffpost that claim is false and misleading we have never had an employee file a sexual harassment arbitration if the past year or so has taught us anything its that even companies with the best intentions and the most sensitive executive leaders dont catch every bad actor opponents of forced arbitration say that getting rid of such secretive practices is key to combating sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace the easiest mistake any employer can make is to assume that this could never happen here microsoft president brad smith wrote in a december blog post announcing that the company would no longer send harassment to arbitration while its natural to hope and believe thats the case one of the fundamental lessons of recent months is that peoples voices need to be heard if their problems are to be addressed microsoft is currently in the middle of a gender discrimination suit filed by a former female technical employee microsoft is the one major tech company thats thrown its support behind the the ending forced arbitration of sexual harassment act the bill introduced by rep cheri bustos dill in december would make it illegal to force employees to take sexual harassment suits to private arbitration instead employees would have a choice in the matter giving them more leverage in going up against a deeppocketed corporation im glad facebook says they feel theyre taking harassment seriously but i had hope that theyd actually lean in and lead by example on this bustos told huffpost using sandbergs book title to make her point all businesses need to take a look at this issue times up on letting companies use legal tools to sweep harassment under the rug she said the easiest mistake any employer can make is to assume that this could never happen here its unclear where the other tech giants stand on the issue google and apple did not respond to huffposts requests to talk about the bill amazon would only say that it doesnt use arbitration but the bill actually has some bipartisan support cosponsored in the house by rep elise stefanik rny and in the senate by sens kirsten gillibrand dny kamala harris dcalif and lindsey graham rsc former fox news host gretchen carlson is also pushing for the legislation helping announce it on capitol hill at the end of the year carlson drew attention to forced arbitration in 2016 by maneuvering around her employment contract and suing her harasser directly in court the bill gives women and men a choice do they want a harassment claim to go to secret arbitration or utilize their 7th amendment right and go to a public court carlson said in a message to huffpost any company outwardly lobbying against this bill makes one wonder what they may have to hide because of the secrecy of the arbitration process its difficult to say how many women it silences in one egregious example the washington post was able to learn about hundreds of women accusing sterling jewelers the multibillion dollar company behind kay jewelers and jared of widespread discrimination bustos said that the sterling story was the first time shed even heard of forced arbitration and it inspired her to craft this legislation for every journalistic scoop however many more cases are forever buried facebook has spent thousands of dollars lobbying on the arbitration bill according to public records but theres no indication in the record of where the company stands on the bill facebook for its part said that the money was spent to research the legislation not to argue a particular stance as of publication facebooks lobbying firm had not amended its lobbying disclosure facebook has hundreds of lawyers and lobbyists advising them on law and policy we are talking about a twopage bill that was introduced last year on an issue that is in the news every day said andrew rogers the director of legislative affairs at the american association of justice a nonprofit advocacy group for plaintiffs lawyers that opposes arbitration any company that says it is still mulling it over isnt acting in good faith and is just hoping the movement quietly fades away rogers said microsoft endorsed the bill last year he pointed out im glad facebook says they feel theyre taking harassment seriously but i had hoped that theyd actually lean in and lead by example on this another sign that the bill has momentum in february all 50 state attorneys general took the rare step of joining together to call companies to end the practice and for congress to pass the bill ending mandatory arbitration of sexual harassment claims would help to put a stop to the culture of silence that protects perpetrators at the cost of their victims the letter says about 601 million workers in the us are beholden to mandatory arbitration clauses according to a study released last year by the progressive economic policy institute many of them have no idea you can agree to give up your right to file a lawsuit simply by accepting an employee handbook employees win in arbitration only 21 percent of the time according to an earlier paper from epi a much lower rate than youd find in state or federal court and if they win monetary damages are far lower as well less than half of what a victim would be awarded in court if a victim loses many companies will require her to pay arbitration fees many employee complaints never even make it to arbitration because the deck is so stacked against them for one thing lawyers are reluctant to take on clients in arbitration where payouts are much lower writes nyu law professor cynthia estlund in a working paper published in february called the black hole of mandatory arbitration almost half of companies that use arbitration clauses also include language in them that prevents employees from joining together in class action suits estlund notes that means that if a group of female employees were all harassed by the same man they would each have to sue the company individually thats a huge disadvantage to employees who are already far less empowered than the company theyre fighting the issue is currently before the supreme court former facebook engineer chia hong sued facebook for sexual harassment and discrimination in 2015 hong alleged she was frequently ignored and belittled in meetings where she was sometimes the only woman was admonished for taking a personal day each month to volunteer at her kids school and was ordered to serve drinks to male colleagues her case was dismissed that year but its not clear why facebook would only say that it didnt go to arbitration meanwhile with or without facebooks support it remains unlikely that the bill will be brought to the floor in the republicanmajority house anytime soon bustos has been tweeting at house speaker paul ryan rwis every day this month asking him to bring the bill to a vote this is in his hands he could make a decision or he could take the side of sexual harassers she said day 8 of womenshistorymonth speakerryan instead of sending congress home before noon on internationalwomensday we should have been voting on our bipartisan bill to drive sexualharassment out of

economy reuters alphabet incs google will shut down the consumer version of its failed social network google and tighten its data sharing policies after announcing on monday that private profile data of at least 500000 users may have been exposed to hundreds of external developers the issue was discovered and patched in march as part of a review of how google shares data with other applications google said in a blog post no developer exploited the vulnerability or misused data the review found shares of its parent company alphabet closed down 1 percent at 115592 following the latest in a run of privacy issues to hit big us tech companies the wall street journal reported earlier that google opted not to disclose the security issue due to fears of regulatory scrutiny citing unnamed sources and a memo prepared by googles legal and policy staff for senior executives google feared disclosure would invite comparison to facebook incs leak of user information to data firm cambridge analytica the journal reported adding that chief executive sundar pichai had been briefed on the issue google declined to comment beyond its blog post google said on monday none of the thresholds it requires to disclose a breach were met after reviewing the type of data involved whether it could identify the users to inform establish any evidence of misuse and whether there were any actions a developer or user could take to protect themselves security and privacy experts and financial analysts questioned the decision users have the right to be notified if their information could have been compromised said jacob lehmann managing director at legal firm friedman cyzen this is a direct result of the scrutiny that facebook dealt with regarding the cambridge analytica scandal google has shut down google due to a massive privacy vulnerability pictwittercomk4ys9gvxpc google launched in 2011 as the advertising giant grew more concerned about competition from facebook which could pinpoint ads to users based on data they had shared about their friends likes and online activity google copied facebook with status updates and news feeds and let people organize their groups of friends into what it calls circles but google and the companys other experiments with social media struggled to win over users because of complicated features and privacy mishaps facebook introduced a feature that allowed users to connect their accounts with their profiles on dating music and other apps google followed suit letting outside developers access some google data with users permission the bug disclosed on monday introduced in a software update exposed private data including name email address occupation gender and age google said it could not definitely say how many users were affected because it said it keeps only two weeks of such records google will remain an internal networking option for organizations that buy googles g suite a bundle of apps for creating documents spreadsheets and presentations googles plan to withdraw the free version of google scheduled for august could help strengthen its case to us policymakers and regulators that it is different from facebook which has faced political heat over allegations that data belonging to 87 million of its users was improperly shared with political consultancy cambridge analytica google refused to send pichai to a senate intelligence committee hearing on sept 5 where facebooks chief operating officer and twitter incs chief executive testified an empty chair was left for google after the committee rejected googles top lawyer as a witness several policies google introduced on monday are designed to curb the data accessible to developers offering mobile apps on the google play store or addon apps for sending and oorganizinggmail messages play store apps will no longer be allowed to access text message and call logs unless they are the default calling or texting app on a users device or have an exception from google gmail addons available to consumers starting next year will be barred from selling user data and be subject to a thirdparty security assessment that will cost them about 15000 to 75000 google said we remain

environment wildfire trends in the west are clear there are more large fires burning now than at any time in the past 40 years and the total area burned each year has also increased to explore these trends climate central has developed this interactive tool to illustrate how warming temperatures and changing spring snowpack influences fires each year in our 2012 report western wildfires we analyzed federal wildfire data stretching back to the 1970s to see how fires have changed in the american west in some states like arizona and idaho the number of large fires burning each year has tripled or even quadrupled and in other states including california colorado new mexico nevada and wyoming the number of large fires has doubled over the same span average spring and summer temperatures across 11 western states have increased by more than 15f contributing to the higher fire risks spring temperatures in arizona have warmed faster than any other state in the us rising nearly 1f per decade since 1970 which has likely played a key role in arizonas rapid increase in fires over the past two decades in addition years with abnormally warm spring and summer temperatures tend to be years with more and bigger fires for example 2012 was the hottest spring and summer on record for colorado and the state also saw its secondhighest number of large fires the interactive map also includes a preliminary analysis of mountain snowpack data collected at hundreds of monitoring stations across the west not surprisingly years with low spring snowpack measured as the amount of water in snowpack on the ground as of april 1 also tend to be years with more fires when there is a relatively thin snowpack come spring it can melt quickly as the weather warms leaving the forest drier earlier and much more likely to burn across the southwest in particular several recent years of belowaverage spring snowpack has extended the regions drought and fueled more big fires this record of western snowpack data begins in 1980 so its unclear how well the blue lines in the interactive represent longterm trends and how much they have influenced the growth in wildfires other research has shown however that there has been a persistent decline in western snowpack since the 1920s and in looking at the past 30 years its clear that from one year to the next belowaverage snowpack raises the risk of wildfires western wildfires are also influenced by yeartoyear climate variability and how the us forest service manages fires but the trends of rising temperatures and lesser snowpack hint at what fires will look like in the coming decades researchers predict that the area burned in the west will quadruple for every additional 18f of temperature rise according to the draft national climate assessment report the most recent climate model projections show that temperatures will rise between 2f and 4f across most of the us within the next few decades and as much as 8f by 2100 here are a few states that have seen the most dramatic changes in wildfires since the 1970s spring snowpack has been decreasing dramatically in nevada since the early 1980s and in 2012 the lowest spring snowpack in more than 30 years combined with aboveaverage spring temperatures helped fuel the biggest wildfire year in more than a decade idaho has seen the biggest increase in wildfires since 1970 than any other western state yeartoyear there is still a lot of variability but in the past decade several years with aboveaverage temperatures and low spring snowpack have led to dozens of large wildfires on federal land colorado has the secondfastest warming spring temperatures of any state and in 2012 the hottest spring and summer on record for colorado the state saw its secondhighest number of large wildfires in the past decade more wildfires have burned in utah in most of those years than any year in the 1970s and in 2012 thin spring snowpack and aboveaverage spring temperatures contributed to the biggest wildfire year in a decade spring temperatures have warmed faster in arizona than any other state since 1970 these warming temperatures matched with decreasing spring snowpack have helped increase wildfire risk every year since 2004 has seen more fires burn in arizona than in any year in the 1970s spring warming in new mexico is among the top three fastest in the country in the past decade many more wildfires burned in new mexico than during the 1970s and 1980s but the yeartoyear variations in wildfires depend on several factors including temperatures spring snowpack and how large the previous years wildfires were wildfire data is based on fires larger than 1000 acres that burned on us forest service land in the 11 western states temperature data was analyzed according to the methodology described in the heat is on but for spring and summer temperatures spring snowpack is represented by april 1 snowwater equivalent measurements collected by the snotel network

technology facebook is kicking off its f8 conference by heading off everyones most pertinent question what is the platform doing to address user data concerns the answer it seems is clear history a new feature the social network is building to give users more control over the information it collects from your browsing history by popular demand from users and congresspeople alike facebooks chief privacy officer announced in a post that clear history will be both a monitoring tool and a set of controls it allows users to see which websites and apps using facebook ads and analytics including those with the like button send your browsing information back to the social network then users are given the choice to stop associating this data with their personal account these sites will still collect data on user activity and send it to facebook but if a user optsout under clear historys settings the social platform wont link the info to your personal account this may sound trivial but it means when the network repackages that information into advertising insights to sell to sites and apps user data is folded into general demographic insights not personallyidentifying info as facebook is only just announcing clear history its unclear when the feature will go live for users this article was originally published by engadget

sports amidst increasingly loud retirement rumors the seattle seahawks marshawn lynch looks like he just confirmed that this season was his last on the nfl gridiron never one to be shy with symbolism the 29yearold tweeted an image of cleats quite literally hung up along with a peace sign emoji the tweet came just hours after espns adam schefter reported that lynch had already told friends that he was calling it quits salute to my guy moneylynch it was an honor sharing the field with you lynch has been one of the top running backs in the nfl for the past half decade but was hampered in 2015 by a nagging hamstring injury as well as a november abdominal surgery even after missing much of this season lynch has still totaled the most rushing touchdowns since 2011 with 51 and is among the top three in rushing yards rushing first downs and carries as well despite being one of the leagues premier running backs beast mode is perhaps best known for the january 2015 press conference in which he told reporters hey im just here so i dont get fined the quote instantly went viral lynch will hang it up having amassed 9112 career rushing yards and tallied 39 in super bowl xlviii when he and his seahawks knocked down the denver broncos for the 438 title victory correction this article previously misstated lynchs rushing yards in super bowl xlviii he totaled 39 rushing yards in that game not 288
sports the topseeded boston celtics find themselves in a precarious position its down two games to zero against a chicago team that barely made the nba playoffs and seemingly almost fired its coach multiple times and the blame for bostons woes has predictably shifted onto its boywonder coach brad stevens stevens 40 has dropped 12 of 14 games accumulating the worst career postseason record of all time its a convenient statistic for those pointing the finger his way but the sentiment is unfair to understand why we must recognize that the celtics at their core have a flawed roster and one that has easily been exposed for example despite winning 53 games this season they still lack a true center al horford is a fine player but hes also a power forward masquerading as a five man he has been abused by chicagos 7footer robin lopez who right now is collecting one out of every five bulls misses a clip that easily would have led the league during the regular season the bulls have also dominated the glass thus far outrebounding boston by a margin of 23 then theres bostons helplessness in protecting the rim which has allowed chicagos perimeter players to live in the paint neither horford amir johnson kelly olynyk or tyler zeller are legitimate shotblocking threats as a result jimmy butler and dwyane wade have attacked relentlessly enjoying a barrage of free passes in the lane in one of their better combined performances of the season the duo each scored 22 points in a 11197 game 2 win the performance showed us the importance of having wings who can get theirs in the playoffs bostons most glaring deficiency however stems from its best player isaiah thomas for all his offensive prowess has been put in the blender by bulls point guard rajon rondo who has turned back the clock to his celtic days when he earned four consecutive allstar appearances thomas understandably is not his normal self right now after the unexpected death of his sister but then again the 31yearold rondo who scored 11 points and dished out 14 assists while amassing 9 rebounds and 5 steals in game 2 is simply doing to him what others have done all season its unclear how things will play out now that rondo has been declared out indefinitely with a broken thumb but thomas isnt exactly primed for a defensive turnaround according to espns defensive real plus minus the 5foot9 thomas ranked dead last this season for all point guards so perhaps its no surprise that rondo completely dictated his tempo to thomas in game 2 for example the bulls shot 58 percent when the shot was created by rondo but just 47 percent on all other attempts per espn stats info as one nba head coach told me recently of thomas he just cant defend probably the worst weve seen all year as far as point guards go thomas sheer inability to guard his position puts stevens in a precarious spot he cant bench him because thomas is the main source of offense he couldnt put avery bradley on rondo because it would free up butler and rondos absence doesnt change anything because thomas can still only guard one position jae crowder is a good player but he doesnt have the foot speed to check butler or wade and marcus smart cant play extended minutes because hes so bad offensively finally there is the talented but green rookie jaylen brown who is lightyears away from being trusted on this stage naturally when general manager danny ainge was asked about the criticism of stevens he deflected the blame i think anything is fair ainge said following game 2 i dont agree with them but i havent written this series off yet either i dont even want to go there i think that anything is fair sure any criticism is fair the only fair criticism right now should be aimed at ainge who has been the architect of the entire roster dont forget that he is sitting on gold right now a pickswap with the brooklyn nets in junes draft plus the nets 2018 firstround selection remember the swirling

health want your teen to do well in school encouraging him or her to hit the gym or track court or pavement could help according to a new study researchers from the university of dundee university of bristol and university of georgia found that the more time teens spend exercising the better they tend to do on tests for english math and science the study included data from 4755 youths in the uk part of the avon longitudinal study of parents and children who were followed as they took national exams in english math and science at ages 11 13 and 1516 researchers took note of their amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity which was monitored with accelerometers over a threetoseven day period when they were age 11 they found that the more active the child was at age 11 the greater their academic performance was during the tests in the following years this held true even after taking into account other factors such as socioeconomic status weight and the childs puberty status while the researchers only identified an association between physical activity and academic performance they did note potential reasons for the link for instance studies have revealed relationships between pa physical activity and relevant cognitive outcomes such as measures of executive function as well as studies suggesting that pa might increase time on task in class and reduce classroom problem behavior they wrote in the british journal of sports medicine study previously a michigan state university study showed that physical fitness including strength endurance and flexibility was linked with academic performance in middleschoolers specifically the most physically fit youths had standardized test scores that were nearly 30 percent higher than the most sedentary of their peers nbc news reported and of course its not just physical exercise that could improve performance in school research has even shown that mental tactics specifically mindfulness could help college students do better on quizzes after listening to a lecture

science by geoff gaherty published 05312013 0952 am edt on spacecom although it is one of the largest constellations in the sky ophiuchus the serpent bearer is one of the least wellknown while large in area and prominent in the summer sky it contains no bright stars so it is rarely seen ophiuchus is surrounded by brighter more famous constellations botes is to his right the summer triangle is to his left hercules is above his head and scorpius is at his feet for simplicity ill describe the view from the northern hemisphere observers in the southern hemisphere will need to make the usual corrections like orion ophiuchus is an equal opportunity constellation on the celestial equator he is equally visible everywhere in the world see amazing night sky photos by stargazers may 2013 ophiuchus made the news a couple of years ago when astrologers finally acknowledged his existence even though astronomers have known about ophiuchus for thousands of years and that he literally sticks his foot into the zodiac he has never figured among the astrologers 12 signs of the zodiac astrologers promptly made up a new set of imaginary qualities of ophiuchans which of course are just as fanciful and imaginary as their other inventions if you look at the picture of ophiuchus you will see that he is apparently wrestling with a very large snake this is represented by two constellations on either side of him serpens caput head of the snake on the right and serpens cauda tail of the snake on the left although serpens consists of two distinct areas of sky with ophiuchus in between it only counts as one of the 88 constellations this association with a snake links ophiuchus to asclepius the ancient roman healer in lore who observed one snake bringing medicine to another snake these snakes survive as the two snakes encircling the staff of asclepius symbol of medicine ophiuchus is a constellation worth getting to know because it is full of interesting objects in particular because of its location just off the milky way it contains a wealth of globular clusters the ancient clusters of stars which orbit the center of the galaxy in fact there are no fewer than seven messier globulars clusters catalogued by the french astronomer charles messier in ophiuchus only sagittarius contains this many messier globulars the finest of these globular clusters is messier 12 sometimes known as the gumball cluster it is easily spotted in a dark sky with binoculars because there is nothing else like it in the open empty area in the middle of ophiuchus except for its nearby twin messier 10 look for two faint fuzzy patches in a mediumsize amateur telescope both these clusters resolve easily into thousands of stars ophiuchus snake also has its share of deep sky objects serpens caput features messier 5 one of the finest globular clusters in the sky while serpens cauda contains the eagle nebula messier 16 famed for the hubble space telescopes iconic pillars of creation image there is one very special star in ophiuchus this was discovered by american astronomer e e barnard in 1916 when he found it to be the fastestmoving star in the sky it still holds that record to this day it moves only about 10 arc seconds a year about half the diameter of the planet saturn but thats more than any other star in the sky barnards star moves that quickly because it is very near to the sun in fact after the three stars of the alpha centauri system it is the nearest star to the sun at only six lightyears away unfortunately barnards star as it came to be known is a very dim red dwarf star and so needs a telescope to be seen in a telescope barnards star is a very ordinarylooking reddish ninthmagnitude star but if you plot its position relative to nearby stars and then go back in 10 years time you will find that it has moved noticeably even in photographs taken a year apart it has moved slightly so on one of these fine summer evenings have a look at ophiuchus with his beautiful

social theres always gonna be another mountain im always gonna wanna make it move always gonna be an uphill battle sometimes im gonna have to lose aint about how fast i get there aint about whats waitin on the other side its the climb note to presidential candidates come up with a more appropriate metaphor for the next federal educational initiative the current one is ridiculous at best just what were the planners and handlers thinking when they came up with the name for the largest national education initiative in history the phenomena of racing and reaching the top couldnt possibly have been the goals set for childrens education anyone who knows anything about the fragile unpredictable erratic selfconscious development of a youngster couldnt possibly have come up with such a name but lets pause to reconsider the possibilities maybe critics of the feds should take a minute to do a close read of the name and give the planners a break maybe they had something else in mind lets try a thought experiment what if the federal education bureaucrats were dog whistling to the rich folks to get them on board with the initiative maybe its chase to the top for the bankers and billionaires who are in thrall with destroying public schools and privatizing education the unrelenting attacks on teacher unions the proliferation of charter schools the imposition of frustrating and impossibly difficult tests then selling products to help with testing may seem entirely appropriate to those who reap the rewards from the market approach to schooling teachers bashed children anxious parents confused sounds like a plan maybe its white race to the top sounds plausible since the rttt mandates and the nclb policies have done little to change the intractable achievement gaps and even less to address segregated school systems perhaps the greatest obstacle to school success at a recent new york state legislative meeting a meeting to coronate governor cuomo as the king of the new york state educational system a courageous legislator got it right high needlow wealth districts get shafted every time 1 this includes impoverished white communities as well poor people please understand theres just so much room at the top privileged white communities occupy the space and theres no sign they will subdivide the notion that the federal and state education plans foremost objective is to help the inner city schools and the disenfranchised is a convenient lie politicians are fond of citing miraculous stories of schools in poor communities improving but these are outliers examples of schools with unique circumstances andor infusions of grant money these are outliers the politicians are just plain liars oh for the good ol days when no child left behind was the lead catch phrase i pine for the compassionate conservative approach and remember not only does no child left behind have a sweet sound it promises proficiency for all by 2014 i must have missed the celebration sounds more like no guile left behind but thats for another day for nascar enthusiasts maybe its race to the pit stop this version borrows a page from racings pit crews experts at refueling changing tires and making mechanical adjustments with lightning speed so their team car can get back on the track sounds eerily like the schoolhouse intervention crews who are called in to remediate the troubled and disabled kids who may not be able to successfully finish the assessment race with the fear of failure looming over all students and teachers alike the sidelined kids are oiled gassed up adjusted and made ready for the hunger games and for the merchants who sell us our goods an apt term might be race to the shop take black friday for example customers wait on line all night rush into the store when it opens and get 20 percent off on a toaster seems like a good comparison to school assessments students prepare for tests all year arrive early to school to be ready and receive a number for their efforts they dont even get to take home an appliance parenthetically the heavyhanded approach to improve achievement through standardized tests mainly to compete with countries like finland is breathtaking in its stupidity a recent article 2 about finnish schools reports that the finns are adopting more collaboration more play more essential real world questions in their helsinki schools readying the approach for all finnish schools not a multiple choice question in sight a question to consider using the united states method hearing of the finnish initiative the us secretary of education is a wondering what an essential question is b asking his speech writers to stay late at the office c calling pearson to speed up his transition to the corporate world ive got it race to the tap theres no way that americans can stay sober when they see their children crying and anxious at the end of open school night the bars are packed with redeyed stupefied pta members who try to make sense of it all then they get tired forget why they were upset and the next day it starts all over again for those who have begun calling it just plain crap they obviously have no poetic sense and they must have listened to the remarks of david coleman the architect of the common core and now the president of the college board at a new york state department of education meeting 3 here verbatim is a portion of the exchange he had with educational leaders from around the state do people know the two most popular forms of writing in the american high school today it is personal writing it is either the exposition of a personal opinion or it is the presentation of a personal narrative the only problem forgive me for saying this so bluntly as you grow up in this world you realize people really dont give a shit about what you feel or what you think so now we have the metaphor that best captures the essence of the initiative so mr or mrs future president please listen carefully if we believe that our children should get the message that other people dont care what they feel or think as they grow up then we have turned into bottom feeders to all those who believe that children should race as they struggle to the top lets remember its not how fast we get there its the climb and forgive me for saying this so bluntly we dont give a shit what david coleman feels or thinks 1tedisco challenges

science marijuana may be gaining acceptance around the nation but that doesnt mean medical research has stopped raising questions about its safety case in point a new study on teens that suggests marijuana dependence may be a bigger problem than many people realize for the smallscale study researchers evaluated 127 teenagers being treated at an outpatient substance use disorder clinic in boston the study showed that of the 90 teens who cited marijuana as the substance they used most frequently 76 met criteria for cannabis dependenceincluding increased tolerance of cannabis and unsuccessful efforts to cut back or stop using despite medical or psychological problems exacerbated by cannabis according to a written statement issued by massachusetts general hospital in boston and 36 of the 90 experienced anxiety irritability depression or other symptoms considered hallmarks of drug dependence our results are timely given the changing attitudes and perceptions of risk related to cannabis use in the us dr john kelly associate professor of psychiatry in addiction medicine at harvard medical school and the studys senior author said in the statement as more people are able to obtain and consume cannabis legally for medical and in some states recreational use people are less likely to perceive it as addictive or harmful but research shows that cannabis use can have significant consequences and we know that among adolescents it is second only to alcohol in rates of misuse but context is necessary when discussing marijuana dependence paul armentano deputy director of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws norml told yahoo health he said that cannabis is far less addictive than either alcohol or tobaccoand that symptoms of marijuana withdrawal tend to be shorterlived and as dr asaf keller a professor in the department of anatomy neurobiology at the university of maryland school of medicine told the huffington post in an email the withdrawal symptoms reported by the teens in this study were mild they are nothing like the symptoms associated with heavier drugs he said i am concerned about the use of the generic term withdrawal in this context as it raises unwarranted concern of course many are convinced that marijuana can be used to treat a range of maladies including childhood epilepsy and certain forms of cancer but kellys concern was echoed by dr matthew j smith research assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine in chicago and a noted authority on the medical aspects of marijuana the belief that cannabis is not addictive is quite inaccurate as thousands of individuals become addicted to cannabis he told the huffington post in an email i think the message to teens and families is that research suggests that cannabis abuse or dependence or even recreational use during adolescence may be detrimental to brain development as well as produce physical withdrawal symptoms we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again according to the national institute on drug abuse about 9 percent of all marijuana users become addicted the percentage rises to about 17 percent in those who start using marijuana at an early age according to the institute and reaches up to 50 percent for people who use marijuana on a daily basis whats next for americas continuing conversation about marijuana kelly called for additional research to assess the publics changing attitudes toward marijuana and to reduce misconceptions about it saying in the statement that the research could help predict whether increased education and awareness could help reduce the onset of and harm caused by cannabis use disorders the study was published online by the journal of addiction medicine
politics mitch mcconnell r was in his element back home in kentucky speaking at a paducah area chamber of commerce lunch early in his appearance after going through a litany of what he said were president joe bidens failures he turned to ukraine as an area of bipartisanship let me just tell you that i think beating the russians in ukraine is the single most important thing to world peace that were dealing with at the moment the russians simply have to be defeated he said july 5 some people write me and say well why did we send 40 billion over there well the answer to that is it costs us a lot more to do it later he said some of those people are in mcconnells own party including donald trump who could be the partys presidential nominee again in 2024 and that presents a problem for mcconnell and president joe biden helping ukraine which started off with broad public and bipartisan support is at risk of becoming yet another casualty of todays polarized politics according to morning consult polling while a plurality of all voters see the united states as doing the right amount to help ukraine republican voters were the only group more likely to say the us was doing too much at 28 than too little 25 a june poll for the university of maryland found that willingness to tolerate substantially or somewhat higher levels of energy prices and inflation had dropped off for republican voters compared to overall voters in a similar march survey some people write me and say well why did we send 40 billion over there well the answer to that is it costs us a lot more to do it later with the war near a standstill in the countrys eastern region ukraine will have to come back for more money eventually and if republicans win one or both chambers of congress it is by no means clear more aid will be forthcoming rep matt gaetz the firebrand house republican from florida said as much in a july 1 exchange with rep ruben gallego dariz answering a tweet from gallego that said fact is if the republicans take over the house in 2022 us support to ukraine will come to a halt gaetz replied ruben is correct at a recent rally in anchorage alaska trump riffed on the cost so far misstating the amount spent like with ukraine we put up 60 billion and europe put up 5 6 billion ok he said drawing boos from the crowd through early july congress has authorized about 54 billion for assistance not only to ukraine but to neighboring countries as well in response to the russian invasion and trump is by no means alone among republicans on the last aid package 11 gop senators voted against more money including kentuckys rand paul we dont have any money for anyone he told huffpost i mean were a trillion dollars in the hole every year so any money that is allocated to send to a foreign country has to be borrowed first from another foreign country the outlook in the senate is arguably better for ukraine than in the house with mcconnell and majority leader chuck schumer dny presenting a mostly united front on the issue so far in the house where republicans have the best chance to take over and where 57 members of the conference voted against the last aid package the picture is murkier republican leader kevin mccarthy calif is expected to get the speakers gavel if the gop picks up the handful of seats it needs in the fall to win control but mccarthys grip on the conference is somewhat tenuous which could lead him to have to make promises to secure the 218 votes needed for the speakership one obvious potential spoiler group the house freedom caucus which hounded the two most recent republican speakers john boehner and paul ryan members of the group have complained about the biden administration caring more about ukraines borders than the usmexico border ohio republican jim jordan one of the freedom caucus veterans and a vote against the last aid package said the group has yet to talk about the issue in depth if republicans win supporting further aid to ukraine would have to be a broader conferencewide call he said its got to be a conference decision and look we havent won yet weve got to win he said requests for comment with mccarthys office were not answered rep steny hoyer the maryland democrat who is secondincommand in house leadership said a majority of the house and senate were not for giving up on ukraine even if some in the republican party were my view is that there are obviously putin sympathizers trump obviously being one within their party and i think thats unfortunate he said putin must not win this effort or every twobit tinhorn dictator in the world will think they can do the same hoyer said one gop aid foe sen cynthia lummis of wyoming said she was looking for ways to help ukraine without using taxpayer dollars she said she expects another round of aid to be approved this calendar year but she wanted to see if international monetary fund reserve assets could be used instead sen john cornyn texas the secondranking senate republican said he worried about ukraine fatigue and that there was a legitimate case that other nato allies and europe pay more we remain committed to providing you with the

technology editors note this post is part of a series produced by huffposts girls in stem mentorship program join the community as we discuss issues affecting women in science technology engineering and math i recently wrote engineered to succeed lessons from a student pursuing a stem science technology engineering math career and began with a quote from president obama i begin part two with a quote from the first lady if were going to outinnovate and outeducate the rest of the world weve got to open doors for everyone we need all hands on deck and that means clearing hurdles for women and girls as they navigate careers in science technology engineering and math first lady michelle obama sept 26 2011 previously i focused on cindy arteaga and her experiences as a young latina woman studying civil engineering and mathematics at southern methodist university and the path that brought her to that career choice part two provides a high school principals perspective on mentoring young women embarking on stem careers mansoureh tehrani is principal of metsa math engineering technology and science academy in carrollton texas before becoming an educator she had an it career spanning 15 years at companies such as texas instruments apple computers and american airlines and knows from the inside what it takes to succeed in a stem career in many ways my own career path paralleled mansourehs from my own early work experiences moving through the ranks in the high tech and software worlds i understand the challenges faced by young women who choose to pursue this career path i asked mansoureh what guidance she would give to a young woman focusing on a stem career my it career showed me that many college graduates do not have the right skills for the workforce explained mansoureh most knew their content but did not know how to communicate collaborate and innovate i switched careers in the early 1990s to help transform public education many young women do not have women in their lives who can serve as role models for stem jobs in the past and to some extent now girls in most cultures did not see women their mothers their aunts or their mothers friends holding jobs in high tech fields said mansoureh so perhaps they think that kind of career is not for them either but then i point out the number of females in the stem fields has been growing because of schools like metsa and now many women who are working in these fields are mentoring young girls to pursue such careers currently about 25 percent of the workforce in life sciences and 15 percent of the workforce in engineeringcomputer science is female that is better than what it has been but not where it should and can be said mansoureh one thing lacking in most schools is that counselors do not have the necessary training to help girls match their interest to stemrelated fields to help address this need for more training new tech network is offering a course on stem for educators who work in new tech schools integrating stem and projectbased learning pbl the course asks the driving question how can stem teachers improve project quality and increase disciplinary literacy through college readiness assessments through projectbased learning new tech network teachers are trained to embed literacy and math to projects that have a real world application i asked mansoureh how she helps young women navigate the challenges of pursuing a stem career in the early adolescent years there is a certain amount of timidity as well as social barriers that young women confront said mansoureh we also see the same happening in university settings where young women in academics are not often sought after as leaders and do not perceive themselves as a team member by engaging young women early on with realworld experiences and showing them how these mentor women are in control and working on engineering solutions for a better world and positive solutions for diseases for example we can help spark their interest and allow young girls to see themselves in a stem career according to mansoureh metsa students also have fieldbased experiences where they see women working in stem fields as well as a variety of college visits where they can speak with female students in stemrelated majors mansoureh explained how metsa works to assure that students graduate college and career ready metsa classes utilize projectbased and problembased learning students are given leadership opportunities to manage their projects in various classes they get feedback from their peers and the facilitators to improve their leadership traits for the next project advisers help students research the best career find the right college apply and look for financial support she said we remain

world said mansoureh we expect everyone to take the initiative to diagnose their learning needs formulate goals identify necessary resources choose and implement appropriate strategies and reflect on their accomplishments towards completing professional quality work in a timely manner the teachers model these attributes for the students and have dialogues with them until it becomes second nature we think its important for a young women pursuing a stem career to find adults who believe in them and their potential and to learn how to build support systems asking for help and learning from every encounter will further enhance the likelihood of success add to that a school like metsa and you have the recipe for a successful college and career stem experience were also working on having schools like metsa be broadly available for many more young women and men
health this piece was written by guest contributor jason fitzgerald a usa track field certified coach at strengthrunningcom and 239 marathoner to learn more about jason check out his website the day you run a marathon the hardest work is already done months of long runs tempo workouts and more mileage than you care to remember are behind you the only thing in front of you is the marathon itself get excited but just because you trained well doesnt mean you can skip the prerace planning a regular routine will help reduce stress on the morning of the race and get you ready to perform your best youll get to the starting line ready to run without the stress of wondering how to get there or where your favorite socks are hiding step 1 plan your morning dont wing it youll have a lot to worry about on race day like running 262 miles so make sure you take care of all your preparations the day before take an extra 20 minutes the day before the race that precious time will help you stay calm when youre rushed in the morning nobody wants to stress out about socks or energy snacks before a marathon step 2 train the way you run even the preparation hopefully during training you did enough mileage workouts and long runs to prepare physically for the stress of a marathon if youve trained well theres nothing to worry about the day of the race should be similar to a tough long run everything from your warmup to your breakfast should be similar and familiar dont just practice running during your training practice everything to make sure race day isnt a shock keep these helpful tips in mind experimentation and new routines are for training when your performance doesnt have to be at its peak your race should be controlled so make sure you dont break your training habits at the last minute with new techniques step 3 know the course and run it well each marathon is different and will present different challenges some have tortuous uphills or quadbusting miles of downhill running while others include hairpin turns and long stretches of solitary running on quiet streets no matter the terrain or obstacles study the course map and elevation profile before race day to ensure you know what youre facing the strategy you take will depend on the type of course courses that start on a long downhill with big hills later in the race like the boston marathon will require a more conservative approach than a flat course like chicago another important aspect of road racing is to avoid the camber of the road a roads camber is when it slopes toward the curb for drainage if you always run with the curb to your left youre essentially running with a leg length discrepancy instead stay in the middle of the road where its more level the only time you want to be close to the curb is when youre going around a tight turn to ensure youre running the tangents step 4 performance anxiety forget it trust your training youve trained for this day and youre ready to perform but you might be nervous and thats okay being nervous is just a good reminder that youre still alive and youre about to do something important dont sabotage yourself by not believing in what youre capable of accomplishing execute the race just like a hard long run and youll be successful the training is done and youve done the work hint thats the secret to good running now its time to test yourself and have some fun out on the race course step 5 dont make this rookie mistake a race cant be won in the first minute but it can be lost in the case of a marathon its always best to run the first one to two miles conservatively and ease into your goal pace running hard from the very start can put you over the pace you should be running increasing your heart rate past the aerobic zone and into anaerobic territory dont burn all that sugar when your body will need it in the final miles of the marathon dont write checks your body cant cash in other words before your next marathon take a half hour the day before to organize your gear and plan the morning of the race youll wake up with less stress and more focus that can be channeled into your race now go get that personal best how do you psych yourself up the day of the big race share your marathon preparation tips in the comments below we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves

science since 1995 stanford mathematician keith devlin has intrigued and occasionally baffled listeners to nprs popular saturday morning magazine program weekend edition with scott simon with his discussions of mathematical topics that somehow manage to find their way into the news it all started by chance mostly as a young mathematics graduate student at the university of bristol in my native england back at the end of the 1960s my role models were the mathematicians who had made major mathematical discoveriesmathematical giants such as leonard euler karl friedrich gauss pierre de fermat and kurt gdel like many young people starting out on a mathematical career i dreamt of joining the ranks of the greatestof proving a major theorem or solving a difficult problem that had baffled the best minds for decades some of my contemporaries succeeded in 1963 only a few years ahead of me the young american mathematician paul cohen solved cantors continuum problem a puzzle that had resisted all attempts at resolution for over sixty years but as happens to the vast majority of mathematicians eventually i had to settle for far less during the course of my career like most of the worlds 25000 professional mathematicians listed in the international directory of mathematicians i solved a number of minor problems and proved several respectable but largely unremarkable theorems i taught at various universities in scotland norway germany canada and the united states where i moved permanently in 1987 and i wrote a number of textbooks for mathematicians and students again fairly typical career moves for many academic mathematicians though perhaps i moved around more than many and ended up writing more books than most but along the way almost by accident i discovered another talent perhaps my true calling an ability to explain often obscure advanced mathematical ideas to a general audience i found that through my words i could make mathematics come alive for others not versed in the subject i found that through my words i could make mathematics come alive for others not versed in the subject it was an unplanned sequence of events that resulted in my pursuing a second career path as a public expositor of mathematics in the early 1980s i grew increasingly frustrated by the fact that magazines and newspapers often carried articles on sciencebiology physics chemistry and so onbut hardly ever on mathematics on the few occasions when they did cover mathematics they did so badly often getting the main idea entirely wrong in march 1983 i decided to do something about the situation and wrote a short piece and sent it in to the british national newspaper the guardian a few days later the science editor phoned and informed me that they could not publish it but he said i like your style you seem to have a real knack for explaining difficult ideas in a way ordinary people can understand he encouraged me to try again and my second attempt was published in the guardian on may 12 1983 several more pieces also made it into print eliciting some appreciative letters to the editor as a result when the guardian launched a weekly personal computing page later that year it included my new twicemonthly column micromaths the column ran without interruption until 1989 when my twoyear visit to stanford university in california turned into a permanent move to the us i soon discovered that i liked my new found role of expositor i have always been passionately interested in all aspects of mathematics and never liked the fact that so many people have a completely false impression of this wonderful subject most people think that mathematics is just about numbers but thats not true at all yes numbers play an important role in the subject but mathematics is not about counting its about pattern and structure its about the hidden beauty that lies just beneath the surface of the everyday world i relished the challenge of constantly trying to find ways to explain new developments in advanced mathematics to the lay readers of my column the frequent appreciativeand occasionally baffledletters i received from readers fueled my commitment even more encouraged by the success of my column i began writing books and articles for a general readership including some for the business world i also gave lectures to lay audiences and started to make occasional appearances on radio and television from 1991 to 1997 after moving to the united states in 1987 i edited focus the monthly magazine of the mathematical association of america and since january 1996 i have written a monthly column devlins angle for the association early in 1995 i got the break that led to my becoming a regular contributor to primetime national radio in the us with the media identity the math guy i got a telephone call one day from national public radios saturday morning news magazine show weekend edition the host scott simon wanted to interview me about the solution to the 350yearold problem known as fermats last theorem which became a major news story after the princeton mathematician andrew wiles had solved it a few months earlier never one to say no to a new challenge i trotted off to my local npr affiliate studio to record the segment although scott and i would not meet for many monthsthen as now we record most of our interviews with me in a studio in california and scott at the npr studios in washington dcwe hit it off immediately over the air listeners loved our intimate humorous banterwhich from the start has been completely unrehearsed and spontaneous many wrote in to the program to say so again without any planning i found i had another new role this time a radio personality appearing on the show every few weeks eventually i acquired my stage name the receptionist at the studio i used soon started to greet my arrival with its the math guy i mentioned this to the weekend edition producer one day and he replied oh thats what we put you down as on our scheduling board and so the npr math guy was born this post is adapted from the introduction of keith devlins new book finding fibonacci the quest to rediscover the forgotten mathematical genius who changed the world published this month by princeton university press his math guy segments 94 to date are all available at the math guy sound archive
health there are two ways to get chemotherapy that i know of inpatient or outpatient i had both ways but i found inpatient to be much more difficult to deal with as an out patient at least i could go feel like garbage at home i didnt have a lot of visitors when i was an in patient i got used to being without a lot of people around me and only a friend or two and the nursing staff to keep me company they made sure i never spent a night in the chemo ward alone for whatever reason patients didnt seem to talk too much to one another not much to say i guess it may have been the age gap everyone except one guy was older then me by a wide margin i dont view this as a bad thing i will never forget the first day i was in the chemo ward someone came in with a feverinfection and died a few hours later this would set the tone for the fear for me with every chemo treatment and every infection i had the mans mother crying and screaming is something i wont ever forget i found it really hard being in the chemo ward but i wont complain about it some people had to stay much longer than me some people were there for weeks or even months at a time i am sure some people i met never left that is the saddest part i had to stay five days at a time longer if i got sick the first day in was always really long blood tests meeting with the doctors making sure i was in good enough shape to get the chemo some days you werent it was really hard to go home and prepare yourself mentally again for the next week but even though these days were long the week itself was really more difficult thursday was the worst knowing i only had one more day to go i always wanted to leave so bad my doctor would let me leave for an hour or so when i finished chemo each day it was the best part of my day sometimes i would get out at breakfast too if chemo was delayed it felt like escaping from prison i always had to go in to their emergency room when i got sick this would usually end up with another three to four day stay this happened basically happen a week after every chemo treatment save a few times i never felt like it was an emergency but when you have a fever and people are calling in doctors from their homes at midnight as much as you dont want to believe it is serious you know it is i was usually too sick to care though the chemo ward is depressing is easily the most depressing place i have ever been the smell the pain it was hard i have gone back though stepping back onto that floor after all i had been through it was tough but as i volunteer there now i do it on my own terms which makes it manageable i am not scared of it any more i am glad for the people that work their though they are easily some of the most dedicated and important people i have ever met they were professional honest and organized i could not imagine how busy and difficult that job must be i spent the better part of half a year in the chemo ward it is one of the biggest things that drives me to continue to help people who are there and keep people from having to go there i look forward to a day where the chemo ward is not a prison for anyone and is completely unnecessary

health nasrudin was a mythical figure a teacher from the sufi tradition who supposedly lived in what we now call the middle east one day one of his students walks into a room where nasrudin was reaching into a bag of hot chili peppers and eating them one at a time there were tears streaming down his face his nose was running and his lips swollen and irritated he was obviously in great pain why dont you stop eating those hot peppers the student asked im hoping to find a sweet one nasrudin replied mathew wasnt a bad guy he possessed some fine qualities he was hardworking honest a good provider didnt smoke or drink and he was dedicated to his family but as the years went by his wife julia found herself becoming progressively more unhappy there was something missing from her marriage the absence of which was becoming increasingly painful and difficult to accept whenever julia brought up a subject that she wanted to address if mathew didnt want to talk about it he simply refused to engage in the conversation more often than not he would simply say just i dont want to talk about it if pressed he would tell julia thats just the way i am meaning my personality doesnt incline me to engage in those kinds of conversations but it wasnt just mathews unwillingness to engage in conversations that was distressing julia it was his lack of motivation to learn anything about overcoming his resistance to conversing on a more meaningful level mathew used his conversation stoppers to justify his choices and to get julia to accept him the way he was and get her off of his back some of the subjects that julia wanted to discuss with mathew were very personal and related to his hygiene he often neglected to brush his teeth and his bad breath was offensive to julia he also had body odor because he didnt shower regularly mathew often dropped his dirty clothes on the floors of various rooms and didnt bother to pick them up julias attempts to bring these issues to his attention were usually met with you knew this about me when you married me as if to say she should just shut up and live with it when julia informed mathew that she had found a couples counselor to help them discuss their communication difficulties he said i dont believe in marriage counseling it became increasingly obvious to julia that he had no interest in changing his position regarding his refusal to join her in discussions that were important to her she attempted to rationalize her unhappiness by repeatedly reminding herself of all of his positive qualities she considered the possibility that her expectations of mathew were unrealistically high and that she should lower them despite her efforts she found herself unable to adjust to what was increasingly feeling like a painfully distant relationship finally she reached the point where she could no longer tolerate the situation julia admitted to herself that mathews problem wasnt an inability to change but an unwillingness to do so in coming to this realization she recognized that the difference in their basic life values was too discrepant for them to make a life together and sadly she filed for divorce julia finally stopped hoping for a sweet one when i spoke to her following the divorce julia said to me you know mathew was right he was pretty closemouthed and closeminded when we dated and when we got married i just didnt want to see it for years i hoped that he would change i thought that my love would be enough to motivate him to open his heart i realize now how blind i was to his dark side its not as if he prevented me from seeing him clearly i just didnt want to see his shortcomings i was such a romantic back then i believed that love conquers all im wiser now and have learned the hard way what i must have in my life i feel hopeful for my next serious relationship because i know what really matters the most to me now im not willing to live without it regardless of whatever else im getting from my partner there is a big difference between on the one hand being patient and tolerant keeping our attention on ourselves doing our own work having realistic expectations and being forgiving and on the other hand putting up with behaviors that are contemptuous and disrespectful and tolerating conditions that dont support ones selfrespect and needs for emotional intimacy it was years into her marriage before julia could tell the difference she chose to blame herself for her marital dissatisfaction rather than recognize her husbands contribution to the condition of her marriage her willingness to take an excessive amount of responsibility for the marriage played into mathews unwillingness to hold up his end when julia recognized that she had been in denial about how much pain she was in and how fixed in his ways mathew was she could finally extricate herself from the lifesapping situation she was living in it was painful for julia to grieve the dream of what might have been she was sadder about losing the happilyeverafter dream than she was about losing mathew but she went on to create a better life for herself and found a partner who was willing to communicate with her and work with the issues that came up in their relationship healthy relationships require wholehearted participation and a willingness on the parts of both partners to take responsibility for doing their part this process generally requires more time and effort than we think it should and the temptation is to focus on the other persons contribution to unresolved problems rather than look

around at some point like the song says youve gotta know when to hold em and when to fold em not all relationships can or should be saved knowing if and when to make that call is a critical piece of information that we need to have in order to know which path to take the truth is sometimes painful to hear but ultimately much less painful than it is to keep eating those hot peppers in the hopes of

poll showed him with 19 support after providing respondents a brief description of patel weve tapped into both a moment and an argument for change here against two incumbents who are running campaigns that are very very much backwardslooking at a time when people are looking for hope and light at the end of the tunnel patel told huffpost patels advance in his internal polling follows a month of television advertising he beat maloney and nadler to the airwaves with his first ad in late june the campaigns poll conducted by whitman insight strategies used live phone and texttoweb questions among 300 likely democratic primary voters the margin of error was plus or minus 565 percentage points there is a major caveat when assessing the significance of patels july poll however in june whitman insight strategies tested patels support without describing his candidacy as well as after describing his candidacy without a description of his candidacy patel registered just 11 support in june for the late july survey the pollster decided to ask respondents about how they planned to vote only after describing patels candidacy that decision suggests the campaign wanted to highlight only the number that would make patel look more competitive primaries are often difficult to accurately poll a race in late august decoupled from statewide intraparty contests could be especially tough to survey a federal judge required new york to postpone congressional primaries for about two months so candidates would have enough time to campaign in the new districts in new yorks 12th polling has been accordingly sparse maloney led nadler by 10 points and patel had just 4 support in a may survey conducted by emerson college for pix11 the primary in new yorks 12th has been dominated by very public sniping between nadler and maloney both of whom are approaching 30 years in congress nadler has argued that he is more progressive than maloney noting his support for the iran nuclear agreement and opposition to the iraq war maloney has drawn on her career as a trailblazing female elected official to argue that she is bestequipped to confront the countrys challenges following the supreme court decision overturning a federal right to abortion she concludes her first tv ad with the words you cannot send a man to do a womans job patel an east village resident who identifies as a pragmatic progressive has proposed a suite of policies designed to combat inflation that he calls the abundant society he also espouses a noninterventionist foreign policy that is closer to nadlers than maloneys in orientation and has attacked maloney for previously amplifying skepticism of childhood vaccination regimens patels main focus however has been in appealing to voters interested in a new generation of leadership especially people living in parts of manhattan that neither maloney nor nadler currently represent the election will be a referendum on their effectiveness contrasted with a message for the future patel predicted this is patels third consecutive campaign to unseat maloney who lives on manhattans upper east side the contest fundamentally changed in april however when new yorks top court struck down new york democrats redistricting lines and ordered the drawing of nonpartisan congressional and state senate boundaries the new courtordered maps that emerged in may placed patel maloney and nadler a resident of manhattans upper west side in the same district rana abdelhamid a leftwing google employee from astoria queens subsequently withdrew from the race leaving the

worldnews president donald trump on tuesday hurled the united states into a complex and escalating dispute between the state of qatar and several of its middle eastern neighbors trump tweeted his support for the decision by saudi arabia and several other persian gulf nations to cut ties with qatar accusing the longtime us ally and host to an instrumental us military base of funding extremists perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism trump said trumps brazen comments tuesday were the latest in a series of diplomatic moves that have antagonized foreign governments and thrown into question some of the us longest and strongest alliances fundamentally trump in the last 4 months has demonstrated that he doesnt understand or doesnt care how america has engaged the world for the last 70 years former us ambassador to nato ivo daalder told huffpost trumps attack on qatar came just a day after the president embroiled himself in a diplomatic spat with britain by lashing out at london mayor sadiq khan in the aftermath of a terrorist attack on the city while leaders from around the world rushed to express their condolences and support trump instead repeatedly slammed khan for urging londoners to remain calm trump also used the terrorist attack to argue for the need of his courthalted executive order to temporarily bar citizens of six muslimmajority countries from traveling to the us trumps rhetoric forced british prime minister theresa may who has faced repeated criticism for being too tolerant of the us leader to come to khans defense other british politicians also publicly supported the london mayor who has argued that the british government should cancel trumps upcoming state visit to the uk although trump and khans public animosity was one of the most visible examples of the president conflicting with traditional friends behindthescenes reports about trumps recent visit to europe highlight just how many allies have found themselves at odds with the us president according to meeting notes seen by german news outlet der spiegel leaders from g7 countries including france germany and canada all privately implored trump during the meetings in europe to recognize how instrumental the paris climate accord was to international cooperation trump remained unmoved resulting in an exasperated french president emmanuel macron declaring now china leads during that same visit trump baffled nato allies by refusing to reaffirm his commitment to article 5 of the alliance which stipulates that member states have to come to the aid of allies under attack article 5 has been invoked only once by the us trump also publicly chastised other member states for what he sees as their failure to contribute sufficient amounts of their gross domestic product gdp to the defense alliance trumps refusal to reaffirm article 5 and monomaniacal focus on gdp contributions highlight that he has the potential to undermine decadeslong cooperation that has been vital to us and european interests according to daalder we have built up through our global engagement a set of institutions that have been built on trust fundamentally on trust where allies had trust in the united states to do the right thing when it really came down to it daalder said that trust is broken and its broken because of the kinds of things he has done and not done said and not said there had been hints of how trump was willing to create conflict with us allies early on in his term just weeks after being sworn in the president picked a fight with australia prime minister malcolm turnbull and mexican president enrique pea nieto during what were supposed to be cursory postinauguration phone calls many hoped that trump wouldnt make the same mistakes with a foreign policy team in place however five months into his terms it appears that the president is willing to disregard the advice of the experts surrounding him including national security adviser hr mcmaster secretary of state rex tillerson and defense secretary jim mattis in the case of this weeks diplomatic flareup in the middle east mattis and tillerson had both expressed hope the tension between qatar and the united arab emirates would be resolved soon according to politico trumps national security team was also blindsided by his belligerent nato speech trumps volatility when it comes to international alliances and agreements has already had farreaching implications in the past weeks the leaders of some of americas most powerful traditional allies have signaled they perceive a fundamental change in the united states role in the world and are willing to change their policies accordingly trump seems to be fine being alone and it may have benefits in the short term but in the long term its going to cost us daalder said in acting as if you cant trust anybody else in the world no one will trust the united states hours before trump announced the us withdrawal from the paris climate agreement european leaders put out a joint statement with china to reaffirm their commitment to its goals now is the time to further strengthen these ties to keep the wheels turning for ambitious global climate action said miguel arias caete the european unions commissioner on climate action and energy in a speech days after trumps nato address german chancellor angela merkel also told supporters that europe must become more selfreliant as the us policy shifts the times in which we could completely depend on others are on the way out ive experienced that in the last few days merkel said hinting at her experiences at the nato summit we europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching

will make a substantial investment in its own military as the us gives up its international leadership role the fact that our friend and ally has come to question the very worth of its mantle of global leadership puts in sharper focus for the rest of us to set our own clear and sovereign course chrystia freeland told the house of commons on tuesday to say this is not controversial it is a fact as countries consider what their options may be in the face of shifting us priorities there is also the possibility that some nations will seek to exploit the rifts in international relations to benefit themselves hours after trump tweeted his criticism of qatar russian president vladimir putin was in talks with its ruler to discuss bilateral cooperation
worldnews this article originally appeared on irinnewsorg a news agency specialised in reporting humanitarian crises the un has appealed for record levels of funding to help those whose lives have been torn apart but the gap between the funding needs and the funding available continues to grow and what makes the outlook especially bad for 2018 is that the political will needed to resolve conflicts welcome refugees and address climate change also appears to be waning what a difference a year a new us president and a german election make heres our insider take on 10 crises that will shape the humanitarian agenda in 2018 see 2017s list here as syria heads towards seven years of war and western governments quietly drop their demands for political transition it has become increasingly clear that president bashar alassad will stay in power at least in some capacity but that doesnt mean the violence or suffering is over pockets of resistance are still being starved into submission and being denied aid nearly three million syrians still live in areas the un defines as besieged or hard to reach see eastern ghouta right now while chemical weapons are deployed to horrifying effect theres talk of reconstruction where the fighting has fizzled out be it in areas brought under the governments control or in cities like raqqa which is now controlled by kurdish forces but has a mixed population that is beginning to come home to utter destruction investors are lining up for a slice of the rebuilding pie but an average of 6550 syrians were displaced by violence each day in 2017 so what of the 61 million and counting displaced inside syria many sheltering in tents or unfinished buildings and facing another long winter not to mention the 55 million refugees abroad will they have a say in how syria is rebuilt with reconstruction already a major bone of contention in peace talks and the eu planning to get involved in 2018 how this plays out is important and worth watching you know the situation is bad when people start fleeing their homes and it doesnt get much worse than the democratic republic of the congo here violence in its eastern provinces has triggered the worlds worst displacement crisis for a second year in a row more than 17 million people abandoned their farms and villages this year on top of 922000 in 2016 the provinces of north kivu south kivu kasai and tanganyika are the worst affected and the epicentres of unrest in the country new alliances of armed groups have emerged to take on a demoralised government army and challenge president joseph kabila in distant kinshasa he refused to step down and hold elections in 2016 when his constitutionally mandated twoterm limit expired and the political ambition of some of these groups is to topple him these rebellions are a new addition to the regular lawlessness of armed groups and conflict entrepreneurs that have stalked the region for years it is a confusing cast of characters in which the army also plays a freelance role and as irin reported this month as an instigator of some of the rights abuses that are forcing civilians to flee as we enter 2018 more than 13 million people require humanitarian assistance and protection thats close to six million more people than at the start of 2017 over three million people are severely food insecure in the kasai region alone their villages and fields looted aid is only slowly trickling in the 812 million appeal for congo is less than 50 percent funded that lack of international commitment represents the single largest impediment to the humanitarian response if we repeat the words worlds worst humanitarian crisis so often that they starting to lose gravity here are a few numbers that might help hammer home just how grim life has become after more than two and a half years of war in yemen a country of more than 29 million 84 million people are on the verge of starvation 400000 children have severe acute malnutrition thats as bad as it gets and more than 5500 civilians have been killed last january we warned yemen was at serious risk of sliding into famine that now seems a nearcertainty and may be unfolding right now with the saudi arabianled coalition continuing to restrict or at least delay commercial imports of food and fuel among other goods causing prices to shoot up and meaning those on the margin no longer have enough cash to buy the bare necessities and what of that cholera epidemic that killed 2226 and infected nearly a million since april before receding nobody has been vaccinated fuel shortages mean less clean water and the rainy season is coming all of this combines to create a real risk that the disease will make a comeback diphtheria is on the rise too none of this happens in a vacuum without proper nutrition yemenis are increasingly susceptible to illness a muchanticipated ceasefire in south sudan didnt last long it came into effect at midnight on christmas eve and a few hours later government and rebel forces were fighting around the northern town of koch in unity state the violence hasnt derailed the peace talks underway in addis ababa but it does point to how difficult it will be for the internationallybacked diplomatic process to shape events on the ground the ceasefire is between president salva kiir and several rebel groups but confidence is low that negotiations can bring a quick and decisive end to a war entering its fifth year south sudan has fragmented with a host of ethnic militias emerging with shifting loyalties the various members of this socalled gun class all want a seat at the table in the belief that any future agreement will be based on a powersharing deal and a division of the countrys resources along the lines of the last failed settlement the international community lacks leverage and neighbouring countries dont have the unity of purpose necessary to achieve a broadbased and sustainable peace agreement what that means is that more refugees on top of an existing two million will continue to pour across the countrys borders as the fighting season resumes it also means some seven million people inside the country almost two thirds of the remaining population will still need humanitarian assistance hunger will also continue to threaten millions as a result of the war displacement and collapse of the rural economy and yes there will be the threat of renewed famine one final ingredient in the brew of despair is that the humanitarian communitys access to those in need will be constrained by both the prevailing insecurity and the governments cynical taxation of aid operations there are many reasons why central african republic was officially the unhappiest country in the world in 2017 you can start with the 50 percent increase in the number of displaced bringing the total to 633000 people then there are the more than two million hungry people and the half a million who have figured its just too hard to stay and have left for neighbouring countries its not much fun being an aid worker either in november another humanitarian worker was killed in the north of the country bringing to 14 the number to have died this year the level of violence has forced aid agencies to repeatedly suspend operations as their personnel convoys and bases are deliberately targeted behind the insecurity is a fouryear conflict between competing armed groups that neither a weak government nor an understaffed un peacekeeping mission can contain it pits mainly muslim exseleka rebels against christian antibalaka but some of the worst fighting has its roots in the splintering of the seleka coalition and a feud between former allies the violence across the country boils down to the lucrative control of natural resources and the taxes the groups raise from checkpoints such is the insecurity that the governments writ doesnt even cover all of the capital bangui after a catastrophic year in which more than 655000 people were driven out of myanmars rakhine state its hard to imagine 2018 could go any worse for the rohingya minority but with nearly a million rohingya refugees crowded into overloaded settlements in southern bangladesh the new year brings a host of new questions the sudden exodus of refugees captured the worlds attention but as the crisis shifts from emergency response to longterm survival will the focus and funding keep pace with the pressing needs on the ground can the fragile settlements withstand a significant storm or even the seasonal monsoon rains that will fall in a few short months and will the bangladeshi and myanmar authorities try to make good on a plan to repatriate rohingya refugees despite warnings from any number of aid groups rights monitors and un agencies and a troubling history of lessthanvoluntary returns while rakhine state smoulders longsimmering conflicts continue to fly under the radar elsewhere in myanmar clashes between myanmars military and ethnic armed groups in the countrys north have escalated largely out of the public spotlight in northern kachin and shan states some 100000 people have been uprooted since 2011 when a government ceasefire with the kachin independence army collapsed roughly 40 percent of these people live in areas outside government control but myanmar has also put limits on aid access to areas even under its authority mirroring the more publicised restrictions in place in rakhine buried somewhere is myanmars longstalled peace process involving myriad ethnic armed groups operating across the country a new round of talks is set for later in january but with only a handful of armed groups on board with a tenuous ceasefire agreement and other key players excluded entirely a politically negotiated peace remains elusive afghanistan begins 2018 facing another volatile year conflict has displaced more than one million afghans over the last two years but added to this are the evergrowing numbers of afghans returning from or rather kicked out of europe and neighbouring countries like pakistan and iran theyre coming back to a country that the un in august concluded was no longer in postconflict mode but in active conflict once again one where a resurgent taliban and emboldened islamic statealigned militants vie for control as the governments grasp weakens the problem can be summarised in one ominous chart which shows us military estimates that the afghan government has influence in less than 57 percent of the countrys districts the raging conflict has had disastrous impacts on afghan civilians last year saw civilian casualties soar to near recordhigh levels and an escalating number of people were killed in attacks targeting places of worship something the un has called a disturbing new element to the violence healthcare continues to come under siege with skirmishes severing access to hospitals and clinics and aid workers caught in the crossfire the next 12 months could prove an even greater challenge january is the start of afghanistans food lean season which will hit those already uprooted by conflict particularly hard its now begrudgingly accepted that a viable peace settlement must include the taliban a once unthinkable suggestion but there has been no meaningful progress with parliamentary elections scheduled for july 2018 the battle for control of afghanistan will continue on multiple fronts as the snows melt and the fighting resumes in earnest the descent of venezuela from oilrich powerhouse to economic basketcase has been well chronicled less thoroughly reported partly due to media restrictions under the increasingly authoritarian rule of hugo chvezs successor president nicolas mduro has been the extent of the humanitarian crisis shortages of basic goods and soaring inflation have led to growing reports of severe childhood malnutrition in addition to a general healthcare crisis and to more than a million venezuelans fleeing the country if 2017 was the year when the scale of crisis within venezuela began to reveal itself 2018 is set to be when the full effects are felt beyond its borders the political situation underpinning this crisis is only likely to worsen elections slated for december 2018 are expected to be brought forward and foisted upon a weary hungry and increasingly desperate electorate that is sharply divided unrest or government crackdowns will only send more venezuelans pouring over the border there are already signs that regional hospitality is wearing thin and of emergency camps being prepared the international monetary fund predicted that venezuelas tripledigit inflation could soar to more than 2300 percent in 2018 as the year closed out opposition parties were barred from the election a main opposition leader was banned from political activity for 15 years and violent prodemocracy protests rocked the capital caracas none of this augurs well an aueu summit at the end of 2017 seemed to offer a glimmer of hope for the 700000 to one million migrants stuck in the nightmare that is libya it produced a plan to repatriate those who want it and to move others from squalid detention centres into better conditions some flights home did subsequently take off and a first group of 162 refugees and migrants from eritrea ethiopia somalia and yemen was even evacuated by the un on 22 december from libya to italy but weve yet to see how this scheme will play out and there are some serious obstacles many migrants have nowhere safe to return to and its not clear how a unbacked government that controls little in the way of territory or popular support will manage to move and protect migrants in a country with multiple governments militias and tribes that the meeting even got press in large part thanks to a cnn film of what appeared to be a slave auctions in an oftignored country is a sign of how little the world cares about the mostly subsaharan african migrants in libya for whom kidnapping extortion and rape have become the norm european policy has largely focused on keeping migrants from boarding boats in the mediterranean or reaching their shores creating a situation that is bad enough for libyans and shockingly worse for africans at the summit french president emmanuel macron mooted a military and police initiative inside libya plus un sanctions for peoplesmugglers how this could actually work is anyones guess and it seems unlikely to get at the source of many migrants woes the lack of legal avenues to get out of the desperate situations that brought them to libyas hell in the first place its taken just over a year for political agitation in cameroons anglophone region to turn into armed opposition against the government of

economy washington ap in a buoyant sign for the us economy businesses stepped up their hiring last month as omicron faded and more americans ventured out to spend at restaurants shops and hotels despite surging inflation employers added a robust 678000 jobs in february the largest monthly total since july the labor department reported friday the unemployment rate dropped to 38 from 4 in january extending a sharp decline in joblessness to its lowest level since before the pandemic erupted two years ago fridays hiring figures were collected before russias invasion of ukraine which has sent oil prices jumping and has heightened risks and uncertainties for economies in europe and the rest of the world yet the february hiring data suggest that two years after covid19 sparked a nationwide shutdown and 22 million job losses the disease is losing its grip on americas economy more people are taking jobs or searching for work a trend that if it endures will help ease the labor shortages that have bedeviled employers for the past year in addition fewer people are now working remotely because of the disease a continuing flow of people back to offices could boost employment in urban downtowns and the number of americans who are delaying job hunts for fear of the disease fell sharply from january when omicron was raging to february all signs are that the pandemic is easing its hold on jobs and the economy said jane oates president of workingnation and a former labor department official very strong numbers in very uncertain times other recent economic data also show the economy maintaining strength as new covid infections have plummeted consumer spending has risen spurred by higher wages and savings restaurant traffic has regained prepandemic levels hotel reservations are up and far more americans are flying than at the height of omicron still escalating costs for gasoline wheat and metals such as aluminum which are exported by both ukraine and russia will likely accelerate inflation in the coming months higher prices and anxieties surrounding the war could slow hiring and growth later this year though economists expect the consequences to be more severe in europe than in the united states inflation has already reached its highest level since 1982 with price spikes especially high for such necessities as food gasoline and rent in response the federal reserve is set to raise interest rates several times this year beginning later this month those increases will eventually mean higher borrowing rates for consumers and businesses including for homes autos and credit cards chair jerome powell said this week he plans to propose that the fed raise its benchmark shortterm rate by a quarterpoint when it meets in about two weeks powell has acknowledged that high inflation has proved more persistent and has spread more broadly than he and many economists had expected one figure in fridays report could provide reassurance for the feds policymakers as they assess inflation pressures average hourly pay barely grew in february higher wages while good for workers often lead companies to raise prices to cover their higher labor costs and thereby further heighten inflation but that slowdown might not last if inflation worsens some staffing agencies are seeing a shift in what is driving higher pay previously it was companies need to fill jobs now some workers are saying they need raises to cover rising costs michelle reisdorf a district director at recruiter robert half in chicago who fills permanent and temporary jobs in accounting human resources and other professional jobs said workers are starting to cite higher gas costs when seeking a raise particularly if they drive to offices if they know they are going to have to go onsite five days a week they are definitely asking for more money she said the strong hiring in february occurred across most of the economy with restaurants bars and hotels adding 79000 jobs construction 60000 and transportation and warehousing 48000 though the economy still has 21 million fewer jobs than it did before the pandemic struck the gap is closely fast a survey by the associated pressnorc center for public affairs research found that americans are now much less worried about covid than they were in december and january mask mandates and other restrictions are ending data from the restaurant reservation software provider opentable showed that seated diners surpassed prepandemic levels late last month and figures from the transportation security administration reflected a sharp increase in the number of people willing to take airplane flights as mask mandates have ended and omicron cases have declined customer visits have more than doubled at pvolve an online fitness company that provides athome workouts and has three gyms in new york los angeles and chicago said julie cartwright the companys president the company which employs about 75 has four job openings in data analysis engineering and marketing the vast majority of its customers do the companys proprietary workouts at home over the past four months cartwright has hired 15 people 10 of whom replaced workers who had quit quitting has reached record levels nationally as employers in need of hires have poached workers from other companies in response cartwright said pvolve has provided pay raises and more leadership opportunities to try to retain its employees the company is based in new york city but has also hired remotely since the pandemic hit significantly expanding its talent pool thats a massive advantage now that we can hire really anyone anywhere she said after months of concerns about labor shortages holding back businesses more americans started job searches in february for the second straight month the proportion of americans either working or looking for a job rose to 623 up from 615 a year ago though it remains below the prepandemic level of 634 the number of people who said they avoided job hunting because they were concerned about covid fell to 12 million in february down 600000 from january when omicron was raging gregory daco chief economist at tax advisory firm eyparthenon suggested that the increase in the number of americans looking for a job last month was the most important number in the report that will reduce wage growth pressures and put us on a more sustainable trajectory for the economy daco said among the recent new job seekers was ryan gerard who had quit a sales job last july because he felt burned out by the emails and texts he received at all hours and because his employer wasnt fully comfortable with remote work during covid we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you

science on friday night in oklahoma city russell westbrook took a 3pointer with 01 seconds left in overtime the shot sank through the net giving oklahoma city a one point victory over the golden state warriors that shot will be replayed on highlight reels on otherwise empty courts young players will create their own versions taking shots that lead to last second victories in fictional games enacting such dramas enlivens hours and hours of practice a generation ago young players across the country were shooting layups with their tongues waggling in the air to simply be like mike in the mathematical classroom similar roleplaying can enhance learning rather than being like mike lets see how to be like bill james that is the greats of sports transform the game bill james is undoubtedly one of the greats of baseball his greatest asset wasnt a great arm or bat it was mathematics he is now on the staff for the red sox using mathematics to enhance the team that won the world series again this year further burying the curse of the bambino keep in mind even the giants of sport were younger less experienced versions of themselves michael jordan still had to learn to shoot pass and dribble keep in mind he was always a future nba star but thats something we know now as a sophomore in high school he didnt make the basketball team in wilmington north carolina he did his junior year and had several 40point games in a similar way it is unlikely that bill james when he was first creating the formulas that served as a foundation for what is known now as moneyball was thinking about being named one of the most influential people in the world by time magazine as he was in 2006 many of his baseball articles were penned while he worked nightshifts as a security guard at the stokelyvan camps pork and beans cannery when billy beane applied james ideas to major league baseball and the 2002 as he probably was thinking more about keeping his job than being played some day by brad pitt michael jordan loved basketball and spent hours on the court billy beane loved baseball and wanted to compete with big league teams with even bigger much bigger team salaries bill james also loved baseball and delved into data and analysis to better understand and predict the game like a youth imagining a swish on a playground court wins a big game students in classrooms can act like big leaguers mathematically lets see how to develop bill james pythagorean expectation with students this idea developed out of a math and sports seminar in the charlotte teachers institute the formula estimates how many games a baseball team should win in a season based on the number of runs that they score and allow in particular winning percentage runs scored2runs scored2 runs allowed2 bill james formula has been applied to other sports like basketball lets see how to find a suitable exponent for basketball which can allow students to flex their mathematical muscle and be like bill note advanced statistical methods can be applied for this purpose here we present an approach suitable for many secondary classrooms in moving from baseball to basketball we change terminology points rather than runs are scored now we are searching for the exponent in the pythagorean expectation so it will be treated as our unknown so our equation is winning percentage points scoredxpoints scoredx points allowedx how do we determine a suitable exponent as we saw for major league baseball bill james found x to equal 2 one way to approach this is to find the exact exponent for each team lets do this for 201213 nba season for example consider the miami heat they scored 8436 points allowed 7791 points and won 66 of their 82 games so the pythagorean expectation for them becomes 8436x8436x 7791x 6682 08048 first we can apply algebra techniques and solve warning this can become pretty involved just look at the exact answer x 3log2 log3 log112log2 2log7 log19 log37 log53 alternatively one can make a guess here is how this works lets lean on baseball and take x 2 now 8436284362 77912 05397 which can be found using the google calculator this estimate is too low we will see in a moment that we also want an exponent that produces an estimated winning percentage thats too high lets try x 20 we find which is indeed too high so the value for x lives somewhere between 2 and 20 we can use a method known as the bisection method and simply choose the value halfway between 2 and 20 which equals 11 we try that value now which is too low so we now know that value for x lives between 11 and 20 we again pick the value in the middle and test it in this way we keep finding two values for x one that produces an estimate thats too high and one too low when we get a value that produces a value for the corresponding pythagorean expectation thats close to 08048 we have found our desired value for x which for the miami heat equals 1781 so the value for the nba is after rounding 18 actually no this is the value that works for the heat a value 587 works for the houston rockets and 3335 for the golden state warriors we need to know the value for x for every team for classroom use each student can be assigned a team and find the corresponding value of x so a student assigned the heat would find x 1781 and another would find x 587 for the houston rockets with so much disagreement how do we see anything a few approaches could be taken we can simply take an average of the computed x values for all the teams if we do this we find x is about 12 we could also find the median which equals 15 generally the exponent in the pythagorean expectation for basketball is taken to equal about 14 our average was screwed a bit low due to outliers like the utah jazz they scored 8038 points and allowed 8045 the pythagorean expectation estimates that they should have lost more games than they won think about it they scored less points than they allowed but they won 43 and lost 41 teams that win more games than the pythagorean expectation indicates are referred to as lucky we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your

health as we cruise into the end of the first month of the new year its a good idea to think about the resolutions that we made truth be told my abstinence from chocolate went out the window and im still happily wolfing down the mms but i know that im not alone in breaking my resolutions according to one study as many as 35 percent of all new years resolutions are forgotten by the end of january sometimes though people make resolutions that do stick especially when it is something that is truly important to them the potential for making lasting resolutions was driven home to me during a recent walk around the pond near my house i try to walk around the local pond every day and as long as the temperature is above 65 degrees my amazon parrot shakespeare aka shakey accompanies me yep im the pirate with the parrot thats what some of the pondwalking kids call me shaky and i get a kick out of it because it makes us neighborhood celebrities with the younger set the walking path around the pond is home to an incredible community a microcosm of individuals representing all walks of life during a typical walk around the pond youll bump into old people and young people schoolteachers and college professors municipal workers and doctors shop owners and shoppers homeless people and financially successful people thats the pond in a nutshell and thats one reason i love it one of my favorite pond characters is tony a guy in his 50s who sold hotdogs at bostons celebrated fenway park home of the red sox and fenway franks for most of his adult life hes proud of his fenway vendor days and it shows in his attitude when he talks about them one of the keys to tonys tenure at fenway is his booming voice you could hear him from 100 feet away it was kind of an occupational hazard though he was so used to hollering while selling at the stadium that he forgot how to modulate his voice even when he is standing right next to you i always knew i was on tonys radar screen when hed bellow halfway across the pond hey bawbby hows shake n bake thats what he called shakespeare despite my attempts to explain that my fine feathered friend wasnt anything like a chicken and was no doubt quite insulted by the comparison wed chat about the weather and tony would repeatedly explain the secret of his selling success at fenway you gotta say it like this bawbby get ya hotdawgs heeeeyah if you dont say it right you wont sell many hotdawgs he insisted tony often reminded me about this simple truism and i truly looked forward to encountering him on a pond walk so i was pretty startled about a year ago when i spotted tony slowly walking around the pond i hadnt seen him for about five months and assumed that our schedules had been out of sync as soon as we were within eyeshot i saw that schedules werent the issue though he looked terrible his face and hands puffy and swollen his breathing labored and his skin sallow and sagging the bounce that propelled him around fenway park for years had given way to a plodding shuffle most alarming he was bent over as if hed suddenly aged 30 years bawbby im dying he exclaimed with a scratchy weakened voice doctor says my lungs liver and kidneys are bad real bad bawbby after an awkward pause i said well im sorry to hear that im sorry too tony said and im sorry for calling shakespeare shake n bake thats ok shakey will forgive you i said though i knew better like a lot of people i knew shakey had a long memory for insults and hurts as i made my way around the pond i asked others in the community if theyd heard about tony jason who owns a local bakery said yeah hes been announcing to all of us hes dying thats awful six months later i saw tony at the pond again when we met i could see that hed declined significantly since i last bumped into him his fingers were more swollen and his eyes had sunken into his pasty face he moved at a fraction of his normal speed most concerning he didnt have anything to say i nodded and we continued our respective walks as i finished the loop i figured that was the last time i might see tony and contemplated the impact of his loss on the pond ecosystem our lives were all interconnected and interdependent on so many subtle levels so imagine my surprise on new years day when i set off for a solo walk around the pond it was too cold for shakey about a quarter of a mile into the course the equivalent of a sonic boom swept across the icy water hey bawbby wheres shake n bake i couldnt see tony and thought perhaps he was chiming in from the afterlife but a minute later i stood face to face with him it sure wasnt the tony that id expected to encounter this was the old tony actually restored to his vibrant gregarious self the swelling was gone and his color looked good he moved with the determination and grace of a seasoned hotdog seller bounding his way through the bleachers tony you look incredible i gasped what happened i woke up a couple of months ago and decided not to die bawbby i went to the doctor and told him you know what doc im going to take that medicine and im going to eat what you want me to eat and im going to exercise like you told me to and im going to start walking a lot again too you know why doc i decided not to die no its not bawbby i just decided not to die catch you on the rebound in the parlance of the pond that means see you on a second lap i gave tony a pat on the back and continued my first lap musing about how this exhotdogseller has incredible resolve as much as anyone ive known or read about im certain of one thing his resolution isnt going down in the annals of good intentions that evaporate in the fourth week of the new year tonys now committed to catching life on the rebound again and again hes in it for the whole game
science in december 2012 a german knife manufacturer filed an injunction against martha stewart emeril lagasse and the home shopping network over a very unusual accusation the knife maker known as solingen claims that stewart lagasse and hsn have all been selling counterfeit solingen cutlery knives with solingen germany stamped on one side and china on the other to be precise this isnt a smallpotatoes lawsuit the frauddetection agency document security systems estimates that businesses lose 350 billion to counterfeiters every year and solingen is suing these three defendants for 2 million per mention of the counterfeit knives multiply that by hsns 24hour 365day broadcast schedule to get a sense of the scale were talking about here the good news is that a lot of customers quickly figured out that their knives were counterfeits their first clue presumably being the word china stamped on the side but this case raises some interesting questions without that stamp how many customers wouldve figured out the difference and how long would it have taken them for that matter how do we recognize celebrities like stewart and lagasse as well themselves and not doppelgngers out to deceive us the truth of the matter the latest studies say is that your brains recognition system is neither simple nor always predictable have you ever felt sure youd seen your friends face in a crowd only to realize that youd just creeped out a stranger by staring too long then youve experienced something not too different from the fregoli delusion a psychological disorder characterized by a false belief that different people are in fact the same person in different outfits and hairstyles some recent studies have said that the delusion results from hyperexcitability in facerecognition brain areas like the fusiform gyrus which is the sort of explanation doctors trot out when they know where the problem is but arent sure what it is at the opposite end of the spectrum is capgras delusion a persistent belief that friends or family members are actually impostors intent on trickery freud himself was familiar with cases of this delusion and he claimed as you can probably guess that when a patients brain was rewired by trauma it reverted to childhood instincts like sexual attraction for ones mother which the patients conscious mind proceeded to reject along with all feelings of warmth and recognition toward her as limiting and mindbending as this explanation was it stuck around until neuroscientists came up with some better theories damage to the brains facerecognition areas and the hyperexcitability of fearrelated areas like the amygdala can both play important parts and one research team recently concluded that both are often involved along with inadequate evaluation of beliefs im sure we could all name someone who suffers from that last symptom in short your brains recognition system works on several nearsimultaneous levels it matches people or other objects with memory data it matches those memories with emotional responses and if all goes well it doublechecks those responses for false positives even that may not prevent you from thinking that that guy or gal on the street is more attractive on the first glance than on the second probably because missed opportunities are more dangerous than false positives when it comes to checking out potential mates and that instinct to avoid missing an opportunity it would seem is what drove all those customers to shell out cash for knives theyd never inspected in person i know its what drives my ebay purchases after ive had a bit too much fridaynight revelry this legal battle and these mental disorders and my ebay shopping history remind us of something we could all probably stand to keep in mind in the end all that stands in the way of delusion is a willingness to step back and doublecheck what we think were seeing though we might not all be able to afford agencies like dss to detect fraud for us a lifelong habit of reality testing can serve essentially the same purpose as the old folks in my family like to say if it seems too good to be true it probably is

worldnews la paz nov 10 reuters bolivian president evo morales agreed on sunday to hold new presidential elections after a damning report from the organization of american states oas found serious irregularities in an oct 20 vote won by the leftist leader morales victory last month sparked widespread protests around the country the oas report issued earlier on sunday said the october vote should be annulled after it had found clear manipulations of the voting system that meant it could not verify the result morales speaking at a press conference in la paz also said he would replace the countrys electoral body the department has come under heavy criticism after an unexplained halt to the vote count sparked widespread allegations of fraud and prompted the oas audit morales who came to power in 2006 as bolivias first indigenous leader has defended his election win but had said he would adhere to the findings of the oas audit the weekslong standoff over the disputed election escalated over the weekend as police forces were seen joining antigovernment protests and the military said it would not confront the people over the issue the manipulations to the computer systems are of such magnitude that they must be deeply investigated by the bolivian state to get to the bottom of and assign responsibility in this serious case the preliminary oas report said the first round of the elections held on october 20 must be annulled and the electoral process must begin again the oas added in a separate statement voting should take place as soon as conditions are in place to guarantee it being able to go ahead including a newly composed electoral body the oas said the oas added that it was statistically unlikely that morales had secured the 10 percentage point margin of victory needed to win outright in an outright win that had allowed morales to avoid a riskier second round runoff he was declared the winner of the election with a lead of just over 10 points over his rival carlos mesa the protests erupted afterward particularly because of a nearly 24hour halt during the vote count reporting by daniel ramos writing by cassandra garrison editing by andrew heavens and frances kerry

science this acoustic levitation video might just leave you with a new appreciation for finely tuned speaker setups not because they can play led zeppelin so loud the results register on the richter scale but because when perfectly calibrated the sound waves they produce are capable of helping objects defy gravity a youtube video of the technique uploaded by researchers in japan earlier this week shows sound waves levitating light materials like match heads small screws and transistors the mesmerizing experiments conducted by yoichi ochiai and jun rekimoto of the university of tokyo and takayuki hoshi of the nagoya institute of technology might look like magic yet they actually result from a wellunderstood physical phenomenon in a 2012 article scientific american explained when the speakers are precisely aligned they create two sets of sound waves that perfectly interfere with each other setting up a phenomenon known as a standing wave at certain points along a standing wave known as nodes there is no net transfer of energy at all because the acoustic pressure from the sound waves is sufficient to cancel the effect of gravity light objects are able to levitate when placed at the nodes while materials like water droplets have been successfully levitated using this technique in the past the japanese researchers have taken it a step further using arrays of speakers to move objects through the air in an email to the huffington post ochiai said the team used 285 speakers all tuned to an ultrasonic frequency the resulting standing wave he wrote generates the force which counters the gravity using this setup the researchers could then change the spatial position of standing waves by controlling the phased arrays focal point thereby moving the objects in space we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again watch what theyve termed threedimensional midair acoustic manipulation in the video above

politics jury selection began monday in the trial of steve bannon a onetime top adviser to former president donald trump he is facing criminal contempt of congress charges after refusing for months to cooperate with the house committee investigating the jan 6 2021 capitol insurrection bannon is charged in washingtons federal court with defying a subpoena from the jan 6 committee that sought his records and testimony he was indicted in november on two counts of criminal contempt of congress one month after the justice department received a congressional referral each count carries a minimum of 30 days of jail and as long as a year behind bars by early afternoon eight jurors had been seated in a slowmoving process known as voir dire much of the questioning of potential jurors by bannons lawyer evan corcoran centered on how much of the jan 6 hearings theyve watched and whether they have opinions about the committee and its work in one case a prospective juror flatly told us district judge carl nichols that remaining impartial would be a challenge for him since i do believe bannon is guilty that admission in addition to disqualifying the potential juror prompted questioning of others who had sat next to the man to determine how widely he had shared his opinion the trial follows a flurry of activity in the case since july 9 over a week ago the former white house strategist notified the committee that he is now willing to testify his former lawyer robert costello said the change was because trump had waived his executive privilege claim from preventing the testimony bannon 68 had been one of the most prominent of the trumpallied holdouts in refusing to testify before the committee he had argued that his testimony was protected by trumps claim of executive privilege which allows presidents to withhold confidential information from the courts and the executive branch trump has repeatedly asserted executive privilege even though hes a former not current president to try to block witness testimony and the release of white house documents the supreme court in january ruled against trumps efforts to stop the national archives from cooperating with the committee after a lower court judge ketanji brown jackson now on the supreme court noted in part presidents are not kings the committee has also noted that trump fired bannon from the white house in 2017 and bannon was thus a private citizen when he was consulting with the president in the runup to the riot judge nichols declined motions to delay the contempt trial in separate hearings last week including thursday when bannons lawyers raised concerns about a cnn report that has since aired about their client and what they said were prejudicial comments made during a hearing last week held by the house committee i am cognizant of current concerns about publicity and bias and whether we can seat a jury that is going to be appropriate and fair but as i said before i believe the appropriate course is to go through the voir dire process nichols said thursday the judge said he intended to get a jury that is going to be appropriate fair and unbiased while the judge allowed the trial to move forward nichols left open the possibility that the letters about trump waiving his privilege and bannons offer to cooperate with the committee could be referenced at trial saying the information was at least potentially relevant to bannons defense roscoe howard jr the former us attorney in washington said the best case for bannon is if the information on his cooperation offer gets to the jury even if it does however a claim that executive privilege stopped him from cooperating earlier will be a hard argument to make because bannon refused to answer the subpoena howard said we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again you have to show up to invoke the privilege claim you cant phone it in he said
politics president joe biden marked the 21st anniversary of the sept 11 attacks taking part in a somber wreathlaying ceremony at the pentagon held under a steady rain and paying tribute to extraordinary americans who gave their lives on one of the nations darkest days sundays ceremony occurred a little more than a year after biden ended the long and costly war in afghanistan that the us and allies launched in response to the terror attacks biden noted that even after the united states left afghanistan that his administration continues to pursue those responsible for the 911 attacks last month biden announced the us had killed ayman alzawahri the alqaida leader who helped plot the sept 11 attacks in a clandestine operation we will never forget we will never give up biden said our commitment to preventing another attack on the united states is without end the president was joined by family members of the fallen first responders who had been at the pentagon on the day of the attack as well as defense department leadership for the annual moment of tribute carried out in new york city the pentagon and somerset county pennsylvania in ending the afghanistan war the democratic president followed through on a campaign pledge to bring home us troops from the countrys longest conflict but the war concluded chaotically in august 2021 when the usbacked afghan government collapsed a grisly bombing killed 170 afghans and 13 us troops at kabuls airport and thousands of desperate afghans gathered in hopes of escape before the final us cargo planes departed over the hindu kush biden marked the oneyear anniversary of the us withdrawal from afghanistan late last month in lowkey fashion he issued a statement in honor of the 13 us troops killed in the bombing at the kabul airport and spoke by phone with us veterans assisting ongoing efforts to resettle in the united states afghans who helped the war effort biden on sunday said an incredible debt was owed to the us troops who served in afghanistan as well as their families more than 2200 us service members were killed and more than 20000 were wounded over the course of the nearly 20year war according to the pentagon he also vowed that the nation will never fail to meet the sacred obligation to you to properly prepare and equip those that we send into harms way and care for those and their families when they come home and to never ever ever forget senate minority leader mitch mcconnell on thursday criticized bidens handling of the end of the war and noted that the country has spiraled downward under renewed taliban rule since the us withdrawal now one year on from last augusts disaster the devastating scale of the fallout from president bidens decision has come into sharper focus mcconnell said afghanistan has become a global pariah its economy has shrunk by nearly a third half of its population is now suffering critical levels of food insecurity the president also remembered the words of comfort queen elizabeth ii who died last week sent to the american people soon after the 2001 attacks grief is the price we pay for love biden said those words remain as poignant as they did 21 years ago but the weight of loss also remains heavy on this day when the price feels so great jill and i are holding all of you close to our hearts biden said biden has recently dialed up warnings about what he calls the extreme ideology of former president donald trump and his maga republican adherents as a threat to american democracy without naming trump biden again on sunday raised a call for americans to safeguard democracy its not enough to stand up for democracy once a year or every now and then biden said its something we have to do every single day so this is a day not only to remember but also is a day for renewal and resolve for each and every american in our devotion to this country to the principles it embodies to our democracy first lady jill biden spoke to a crowd at the flight 93 national memorial observance in shanksville pennsylvania where she recalled the concern she had about her sister bonny jacobs a united airlines flight attendant she said the attacks showed that with courage and kindness we can be a light in that darkness it showed us that we are all connected to one another said biden who was joined by her sister in shanksville for sundays

economy washington ap americas employers added 428000 jobs in april extending a streak of solid hiring that has defied punishing inflation chronic supply shortages the russian war against ukraine and much higher borrowing costs fridays jobs report from the labor department showed that last months hiring kept the unemployment rate at 36 just above the lowest level in a halfcentury the economys hiring gains have been remarkably consistent in the face of the worst inflation in four decades employers have added at least 400000 jobs for 12 straight months yet its unclear how long the jobs boom will continue the federal reserve this week raised its key rate by a halfpercentage point its most aggressive move since 2000 and signaled further large rate hikes to come as the feds rate hikes take effect they will make it increasingly expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow spend and hire in addition the vast economic aid that the government had been supplying to households has expired and russias invasion of ukraine has helped accelerate inflation and clouded the economic outlook some economists warn of a growing risk of recession for now the resilience of the job market is particularly striking when set against the backdrop of galloping price increases and rising borrowing costs this week the labor department provided further evidence that the job market is still booming it reported that only 138 million americans were collecting traditional unemployment benefits the fewest since 1970 and it said that employers posted a recordhigh 115 million job openings in march and that layoffs remained well below prepandemic levels whats more the economy now has on average two available jobs for every unemployed person thats the highest such proportion on record and in yet another sign that workers are enjoying unusual leverage in the job market a record 45 million people quit their jobs in march evidently confident that they could find a better opportunity elsewhere chronic shortages of goods supplies and workers have contributed to skyrocketing price increases the highest inflation rate in 40 years russias invasion of ukraine in late february dramatically worsened the financial landscape sending global oil and gas prices skyward and severely clouding the national and global economic picture in the meantime with many industries slowed by worker shortages companies have been jacking up pay to try to attract job applicants and retain their existing employees even so pay raises havent kept pace with the spike in consumer prices we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again thats why the fed which most economists say was much too slow to recognize the inflation threat is now raising rates aggressively its goal is a notoriously difficult one a socalled soft landing

health i tossed and turned in bed unable to find the rest i so desperately craved it wasnt that my thoughts were preventing me from sleeping i wasnt thinking of anything at least not consciously all i knew was that the ball of stress that had settled in the pit of my stomach sometime around march was wrecking havoc on my body and that no matter how hard i tried i couldnt find the happiness that had always been such a hallmark of my personality i couldnt even close my eyes when i did all i saw was candy crush my brain working to obliterate rows of phantom candy again and again preventing me from sleep and peaceful thinking in early march of this year it was announced that the media conglomerate that owned my company would be laying off many employees across its different businesses in an attempt to increase revenue my company wouldnt even be considered for layoffs we were going to be sold off and all of us would lose our jobs in one fell swoop this news came at a horrible time for me i had just moved into the job i had originally moved to new york for i had just become completely satisfied with my life now i didnt know if we would arrive at work one day to find our computers dismantled and hr waiting with exit paperwork as it turned out we had six months before the company would close its doors but we had no way of knowing that at the time what resulted was the worst kind of hiatus it was business as usual with the knowledge that the work we were doing didnt matter in the long run my coworkers scrambled to find jobs difficult and time consuming in our slowmoving and incestuous industry the lucky ones got out early the rest of us were left to suffer the entire situation was very disconcerting i used to anticipate new work assignments but after awhile my response to everything was fk it my coworkers and i all started gaining weight from the stress and unhappiness in the office was palpable work had become a toxic environment and there was absolutely nothing we could do about it other than continue to apply for new jobs that were few and far between how do you cope with uncertainty that you have no way of controlling uncertainty is possibly one of the worst emotions one can feel not knowing the future is inevitable but not knowing if youre secure in your home your job or in love is wrenching the stress of it all does horrible things to your mind to your body to your whole perception of self im a very perky and social person by nature but i saw myself change in unexpected ways as the days dragged on i no longer treated my life as a happy adventure where i would otherwise look forward to my time out with friends spending weekends picnicking in the park and dancing the night away at concerts i started to draw away from them finding solace instead in bingewatching episodes of breaking bad in my apartment by myself i played candy crush obsessively the idea that i could engage in something with a clear goal something i could control was very appealing i tried to work out at the gym but i found that i often didnt have the energy to even make it off the couch what i didnt realize until much later was that my coworkers and i may have had what is termed as an adjustment disorder a fairly common occurrence that crops up when a person has trouble adapting to a major stressor such as financial troubles or a job change sometimes called situational depression the main difference between an adjustment disorder and an actual depression is that once the stressor is removed the feelings of helplessness disappear whereas with major depression the problem is not so easily resolved the symptoms can be quite similar hence my antisocial behavior and general lack of interest in life but the feelings typically dont last as long more than anything it means that the person is illequipped in dealing with the changes in her life and that she has two options either solve the problem or develop some coping mechanisms that kick those feelings to the curb since i couldnt easily solve the problem of finding another job before the old one disappeared i had no choice but to find a way to make myself happy while i applied for new jobs what i found was that although i am typically very good at handling stress ive been meditating since i was 16 and have a very optimistic outlook towards life losing my job meant losing a part of my identity which changed my entire perspective on life suddenly all the work id put in throughout my college career all of the internships the networking the very fact that id moved here for this career was all for waste if a corporation could just dissolve my company with a snap of its fingers did it truly have any meaning if i didnt have a company to pay me for the skills id worked so hard to cultivate what would i do who even was lauren clearly i was having an identity crisis and before long enough id ditch my feeble attempts at happiness through yoga to watch breaking bad and consider dealing meth as a viable career option i wish i could say that i found the key to banishing adjustment disorder but honestly the most i could do was push myself to apply for jobs and force myself to be social while secretly wanting to be home in my sweats instead i definitely had moments when i was at least halfway happy going out of town with friends for a music festival for instance but my impending unemployment was always lurking in the back of my mind the day that i was hired at a new company was the day i was truly happy again and i swear i couldnt stop smiling it was as if all of the endorphins that had been denied for those months came flooding back all at once and suddenly i was myself again i felt as if i were greeting myself as an old friend when i teased the bouncer at a bar and got my friend in without her id when i started a dance party in the middle of the floor when i actually wanted to talk to fellow partiers rather than being immediately put off by the fact that they were happy and secure while i was the opposite the most i can say is if youre going through an adjustment dont let it get the best of you keep pushing for your identity dont let the fact that you dont feel like yourself keep you from living your life you may not want to smile all the time but as long as you try youre winning and while youre avoiding constant resting bitch face identify the situation thats making you unhappy and do your damndest to change it seek therapy if you feel it could be helpful but more than anything dont give up the knowledge that this too shall pass because if you give in to hopelessness youre letting unhappiness in the front door dont be passive choose what you let into your life be the one who knocks we remain committed to providing you with the

health ever walk into the gym wondering if you are doing everything right we all make mistakes and while some are glaring and obvious others may be simple and hard to recognize either way most people dont realize how much these mistakes may contribute to lack of progress in the gym below you will find some common training mistakes that you may be guilty of try your best to avoid these in order to get the most out of your workouts staying in your comfort zone while it is great that you are going to the gym on a consistent basis you may begin to notice a few glaring factors that you may actually be staying in your comfort zone you know you are in your comfort zone when your workouts are becoming easier you are no longer breaking a sweat on exercises that were once a challenge the initial progress you had seen fat loss gains in lean muscle is at a standstill if you notice some of these signs all you have to do is challenge yourself a bit more that can be as simple as adding in an extra set slightly increasing weight used or by an increase of speed or duration of training by making a few small changes you will once again be challenged and begin to see progress after a few days or weeks reassess your training and see if it is time to change one again hanging on ever see people walking on the treadmill at the highest incline and holding on for dear life if that person happens to be you then stop for cardio machines where you increase the incline the purpose is typically to target your glutes and hamstrings if you are hanging on to the equipment trying not to fall off then you have taken a lot of the tension and pressure off of your lower body and have incorporated your upper body more than needed rather than hanging on challenge yourself by lowering the incline or speed to a pace where you are stable and can use your lower body to do all of the work increase the incline as you become stronger this is a great way to tighten and tone up your lower body heavy weightbad form while challenging yourself in the gym is a great way to increase cardiovascular and muscular strength some tend to do it with bad form when you are trying to increase the weight you used for exercise be sure that the weight can be controlled through the entire range of motion far too often people will swing their whole body into a bicep curl or any other isolation move in order to move the heavier weight swinging simply adds momentum to help you move the weight meaning that the muscle doesnt have to do as much work sounds a bit counterproductive right you are better off dropping down to a weight that you find challenging but can control if you are trying to break past a plateau ask a spotter for assistance or complete the exercise with perfect form until you exhaust the muscle there is no need to be a gym hero with the heavy weights you can barely move you will probably end up with an injury in the long run from bad form resting more than working ever find yourself messing with your phone or music in between sets even worse getting in to a fullblown gossip fest that turns your training into social power hour if you notice that you are resting and taking breaks just because you think you need one think again the rest period allows you to recover enough to gain the strength to over exert the muscle being trained once again it is not meant to mindlessly shuffle through your social media pages and lose track of time make the most out of your workout by resting less and working more you should feel exhausted after a good workout not just going through the motions training to eat we all know this person this is the friend who wants to go on a run and follow it up by getting some takeout food you earned that food right wrong while it is okay to eat out on occasion indulging after every training session is a quick way to set your progress back you may burn 400 calories in your gym session for an hour and then be able to scarf down a burger and fries that will tack on the 400 calories your burned and then some if you are looking to change your body composition in terms of fat loss eating out is a surefire way to see little to no progress for individuals who are trying to bulk up and gain lean mass i always recommend the majority of your food coming from a wellbalanced diet or nutritious food rather than typical fast food options dont get me wrong today there are several healthy options around every corner the problem lies in making the proper choices which is always the hard part so now that you have insight on a few common training mistakes are you guilty of any of them by simply changing a few habits you will begin to see changes in your training and in your physique share some of your previous training mistakes in the comments section below

science want to bend it like beckham students at the university of leicester in england have come up with an equation that describes in simple terms just what it takes to kick a curving shot like soccer legend david beckham the four physics students found that the distance a ball bends d as a result of the magnus effect the phenomenon in which a spinning ball traces a curving arc as it travels through the air is related to the radius of the ball r the density of the air the balls angular velocity its velocity through the air v its mass m and the distance travelled by the ball in the direction it was kicked x got that oh well but if the equations meaning is a bit hard to grasp its origins sound simple enough whilst researching new ideas for a paper i read about how physics influences various aspects of football from the clothing they wear to the effects of playing at high altitude one of the students 22yearold jasmine sandhu said in a written statement released by the university the article discussed how a new design of ball used in the 2010 world cup has three dimensional molding of the panels in order to produce a more rounded ball thus affecting the spin that can be imparted this prompted us to examine how footballers use spin on the ball and the factors which influence how much the path of the ball would bend we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again sandhus coauthors on the paper describing the formula were amy edgington matthew grant and naomi rowegurney their paper was published in the university of leicesters journal of physics special topics props to the students but if you really want to kick a curving shot like the footballer whose abilities inspired the 2002 movie bend it like beckham you might be better off reading nasas take on bending a soccer ballor maybe just watching this guy

worldnews washington reuters the white house warned syrian president bashar alassad on monday that he and his military would pay a heavy price if it conducted a chemical weapons attack and said the united states had reason to believe such preparations were underway the white house said in a statement released late on monday the preparations by syria were similar to those undertaken before an april 4 chemical attack that killed dozens of civilians and prompted us president donald trump to order a cruise missile strike on a syrian air base the united states has identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack by the assad regime that would likely result in the mass murder of civilians including innocent children white house spokesman sean spicer said if mr assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons he and his military will pay a heavy price he said white house officials did not respond to requests for comment on potential us plans or the intelligence that prompted the statement about syrias preparations for an attack trump who took to twitter not long after the statement went out focused his attention on a fox news report related to former president barack obama and the 2016 election rather than developments in syria trump ordered the strike on the shayrat airfield in syria in april in reaction to what washington said was a poison gas attack by assads government that killed 87 people in rebelheld territory syria denied it carried out the attack assad said in an interview with the afp news agency earlier this year that the alleged april attack was 100 percent fabrication used to justify a us air strike the strike was the toughest direct us action yet in syrias sixyearold civil war raising the risk of confrontation with russia and iran assads two main military backers us and allied intelligence officers had for some time identified several sites where they suspected the assad government may have been hiding newly made chemical weapons from inspectors said one us official familiar with the intelligence the assessment was based in part on the locations security surrounding the suspect sites and other information which the official who spoke on condition of anonymity declined to describe the white house warning the official said was based on new reports of what was described as abnormal activity that might be associated with preparations for a chemical attack although the intelligence was not considered conclusive the administration quickly decided to issue the public warning to the assad regime about the consequences of another chemical attack on civilians in an attempt to deter such a strike said the official who declined to discuss the issue further at the time of the april strike us officials called the intervention a oneoff intended to deter future chemical weapons attacks and not an expansion of the us role in the syrian war the united states has taken a series of actions over the past three months demonstrating its willingness to carry out strikes mostly in selfdefense against syrian government forces and their backers including iran we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again the united states ambassador to the united nations nikki haley said on twitter any further attacks done to the people of syria will be blamed on assad but also on russia and iran who support him killing his own people washington has repeatedly struck iranianbacked militia and even shot down a drone threatening usled coalition forces since the april military strike the us military also shot down a syrian jet earlier this month trump has also ordered steppedup military operations against the islamic state militant group and delegated more authority to his generals

politics olivia troye a former department of homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to former vice president mike pence said friday theres a reason she went very public about quitting her job in 2020 and suggested current investigations into the missing secret service text messages involve the same person troye appeared on cnn as part of a panel alongside former cia agent phil mudd and government ethics expert norm eisen when she made these claims news anchor jim sciutto asked troye why the missing messages which are linked to the jan 6 2021 insurrection werent actively preserved its a little surprising said troye i have worked technical migrations in the government and i find it a little bit confusing that people were not aware that these messages were going to disappear especially with the amount of planning that goes into these migrations i can tell you that firsthand having done it while dhs inspector general joseph cuffaris office planned to contact all homeland security agencies to assist in recovering the missing messages in february 2021 sources told the washington post it decided not to collect the phones or review any data later that month i came from dhs troye told cnn when you work at the senior levels in the trump administration you know exactly where peoples loyalties lie i know ken cuccinelli and chad wolf and all these people and cuffari very well cuccinelli and wolf were the acting leaders at dhs at the time cuffari notably waited more than one year to report that messages were missing to the house jan 6 committee however he first learned of the messages in may 2021 seven months before alerting them according to cnn troye who famously quit the trump administration in 2020 over its lacking covid19 pandemic response then linked that experience to the dhs inspector generals office which was led by cuffari at the time there is a reason that i went very public with my concerns about the trump administration rather than going through the traditional whistleblower process which would have led me through the inspector generals office at dhs troye said friday on cnn and ill just say that so theres a level of trust there that you understand as for the missing messages the texts were seemingly lost when the secret service switched devices and migrated to a new internal data system a senior forensics analyst in cuffaris office had already prepared to collect some of the relevant phones when one of the deputies who report to cuffaris team emailed investigators on feb 18 and instructed them not to move forward sources told the washington post ive got to tell you being a trump admin person most of the administration communicated on encrypted signal apps apps like signal said troye so a lot of the times these messages were likely disappearing so its a little bit suspect troye went on to add you can either turn in your government phone was there an encrypted app on it was it on their personal phone in any case it seems these messages are gone either way mudd a cnn counterterrorism analyst called the handling of the situation beyond incompetence mudd joined the cia in 1985 as an analyst specializing in the middle east and south asia during president ronald reagans administration how can the inspector general go to congress now and say that you can trust me to conduct ongoing investigations when there are these gaps of reporting to you i think the inspector general has to go mudd said what the heck was the chief information officer at dhs doing mudd added if youre migrating data the first question

politics millions of americans were waiting to learn the fate of their federal student debt on wednesday as president joe biden was set to deliver on his campaign promise to provide 10000 in debt cancellation for many americans and up to 10000 more for those with the greatest financial need details of the plan have been kept closely guarded but borrowers who earn less than 125000 a year or families earning less than 250000 would be eligible for the 10000 loan forgiveness according to three people familiar with the decision for recipients of pell grants which are reserved for undergraduates with the most significant financial need the federal government would cancel up to an additional 10000 in federal loan debt according to a copy of administration talking points obtained by the associated press biden is also set to extend a pause on federal student loan payments for what the white house calls the final time through the end of 2022 if his plan survives legal challenges that are almost certain to come it could offer a windfall to a swath of the nation in the runup to this falls midterm elections more than 43 million people have federal student debt with an average balance of 37667 according to federal data nearly a third of borrowers owe less than 10000 and about half owe less than 20000 the white house estimates that bidens announcement would erase the federal student debt of about 20 million people proponents say cancellation will narrow the racial wealth gap black students are more likely to borrow federal student loans and at higher amounts than others four years after earning bachelors degrees black borrowers owe an average of nearly 25000 more than their white peers according to a brookings institution study still the action is unlikely to thrill any of the factions that have been jostling for influence as biden weighs how much to cancel and for whom biden has faced pressure from liberals to provide broader relief to hardhit borrowers and from moderates and republicans questioning the fairness of any widespread forgiveness the delay in bidens decision has only heightened the anticipation for what his own aides acknowledge represents a political nowin situation the people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss bidens intended announcement ahead of time the continuation of the coronavirus pandemicera payment freeze comes just days before millions of americans were set to find out when their next student loan bills will be due this is the closest the administration has come to hitting the end of the payment freeze extension with the current pause set to end aug 31 current students would only be eligible for relief if their loans were originated before july 1 2022 biden is also set to propose capping the amount that borrowers pay monthly on undergraduate loans at 5 of their earnings wednesdays announcement was set for the white house after biden returns from vacation in rehoboth beach delaware during the 2020 presidential campaign biden was initially skeptical of student loan debt cancellation as he faced off against more progressive candidates for the democratic nomination sens elizabeth warren dmass and bernie sanders ivt had proposed cancellations of 50000 or more as he tried to shore up support among younger voters and prepare for a general election battle against president donald trump biden unveiled his initial proposal for debt cancellation of 10000 per borrower with no mention of an income cap biden narrowed his campaign promise in recent months by embracing the income limit as soaring inflation took a political toll and as he aimed to head off political attacks that the cancellation would benefit those with higher takehome pay but democrats from members of congressional leadership to those facing tough reelection bids this november have pushed the administration to go as broad as possible on debt relief seeing it in part as a galvanizing issue particularly for black and young voters this fall democrats are betting that biden who has seen his public approval tumble over the past year can help motivate younger voters to the polls with the announcement although bidens plan is narrower than what he initially proposed during the campaign hell get a lot of credit for following through on something that he was committed to said celinda lake a democratic pollster who worked with biden during the 2020 election a survey of 18 to 29yearolds conducted by the harvard institute of politics in march found that 59 of those polled favored debt cancellation of some sort whether for all borrowers or those most in need although student loans did not rank high among issues that most concerned people in that age group some advocates say bidens plan still falls short if the rumors are true weve got a problem derrick johnson the president of the naacp which has aggressively lobbied biden to take bolder action said tuesday president bidens decision on student debt cannot become the latest example of a policy that has left black people especially black women behind he said this is not how you treat black voters who turned out in record numbers and provided 90 of their vote to once again save democracy in 2020 john della volpe who worked as a consultant on bidens campaign and is the director of polling at the harvard kennedy school institute of politics said the particulars of bidens announcement were less important than the decision itself its about trust in politics in government in our system its also about trust in the individual which in this case is president biden della volpe said republicans meanwhile see a political upside if biden pursues a largescale cancellation of student debt ahead of the november midterms anticipating backlash for democrats particularly in states where there are large numbers of workingclass voters without college degrees critics of broad student debt forgiveness also believe it will open the white house to lawsuits on the grounds that congress has never given the president the explicit authority to cancel debt on his own the republican national committee on tuesday blasted bidens expected announcement as a handout to the rich claiming it would unfairly burden lowerincome taxpayers and those who have already paid off their student loans with covering the costs of higher education for the wealthy bidens long deliberations have led to grumbling among federal loan servicers who had been instructed to hold back billing statements while biden weighed a decision industry groups had complained that the delayed decision left them with just days to notify borrowers retrain customer service workers and update websites and digital payment systems said scott buchanan executive director of the student loan servicing alliance it increases the risk that some borrowers will inadvertently be told they need to make payments he said at this late stage i think thats the risk were running he said you cant just turn on a dime with 35 million borrowers who all have different loan types and statuses ap education writer collin binkley in washington contributed to this report follow aps coverage of student

social racist bullying is a growing problem that cannot be ignored i grew up in london and id estimate that 99 percent of the british chinese people i have met experienced some form of racist bullying when i recently shared with an asian friend my experience with bullying in school his reply was werent we all while researching my novel the life of a banana i heard shocking stories from ethnic minorities about being physically bullied in school i listened to accounts of being thrown in ditches kicked in the face and spat upon one asian doctor told me that he was beaten up almost every single week in secondary school there are also stories of successful black asian and mixedraced adults who faced psychological bullying as a child they were isolated singled out as different ignored treated as secondclass and told to go back home in 2013 a study published in jama psychiatry looked at the longterm psychological effects of bullying the researchers studied data from over 1400 north carolina kids aged 9 11 and 13 and followed up with many of them into adulthood they found that kids who had been victims of bullying had a greater risk for a number of disorders as adults including anxiety panic and agoraphobia the scars of racial bullying sometimes take years to erase sadly for some people the scars never heal feelings of inadequacy and confusion that come with racist bullying often linger into adulthood i know people who were racially bullied and still suffer from deep insecurities they find it difficult to look people in the eye or lack the confidence of their work colleagues i met a chinese lady who is a very successful banker in a global firm she shared that she finds it terrifying to speak to older white female bosses because she was bullied for many years in an allgirls school a teacher also talked about her muslim colleague who was bullied mercilessly as a child recently when this colleague saw her bully by chance at a teaching conference she ended up hiding in the restroom with a panic attack just the sight of the bully brought this grown woman back to her school days for many survivors of playground taunts and punches speaking in public is a big nono there is deeprooted fear of becoming the butt of jokes just like in school ive encountered victims of racial abuse as children who suffer from depression and anger problems today they put up guards and are extrasensitive to people they feel are out to get them comments are often taken the wrong way and bitterness from the past causes them to lash out they defend themselves so regularly that it becomes routine and they no longer know how to open up to anyone in recent years there has been a worrying trend for 9 to 12yearolds to hang themselves as a result of being bullied i cried when reading about sidney boyimbo nzamale a little 11yearold congelese boy who hanged himself after being bullied at school my heart aches each time i read about children who take their lives because of bullying imagine a child playing with a barbie doll and then taking a scarf not to wrap her doll in but to hang herself with for a child to reach that point of hopelessness is just the lowest kind of wrong in any society from a young age children need to be educated to treat their classmates equally regardless of their race sex economic background and sexual orientation there needs to be a zerotolerance policy for bullying in schools bullying workshops once in a blue moon or an antibullying campaign once a year dont work classroom exercises talks and workshops should be introduced as part of the syllabus anti bullying should be an ingrained part of the cultural makeup of any school it needs to start young as young as possible instead of channeling funds into endofyear plays and musical recitals to please the parents more schools could get involved in something like the bully project kids are expelled for drugs or carrying knives they are given detention when they swear or wear the wrong shoes so why is racist bullying not taken as seriously why do many teachers close their eyes to name calling and small scuffles a south american lady shared with me how other children marginalized her 5yearold daughter because she was too huggy for british culture the class bully threw a sharp pen at the little girls eye and missed it by centimeters when the mother complained her concerns were swept under the carpet i saw firsthand how within two years this little girl changed from a vivacious and smiley child into a sullen and moody girl whom the doctor put forward for counseling children need to know that racial bullying or any kind of bullying is not an acceptable part of society a societal change needs to happen if true reform is to take root something needs to be done soon if not the stories about bullied children committing suicide will keep growing we cannot and must not become a society that becomes desensitized to 10yearolds hanging themselves we remain

science by stephanie pappas livescience senior writer published 09072012 0405 pm edt on livescience a study suggesting climate change deniers also tend to hold general beliefs in conspiracy theories has sparked accusations of a conspiracy on climate changedenial blogs the research which will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal psychological science surveyed more than 1000 readers of science blogs regarding their beliefs regarding global warming the results revealed that people who tend to believe in a wide array of conspiracy theories are more likely to reject the scientific consensus that the earth is heating up university of western australia psychologist stephan lewandowsky based the findings on responses from an online survey posted on eight science blogs according to the paper lewandowsky approached five climateskeptic blogs and asked them to post the survey link but none did now climateskeptic bloggers are striking back with a new conspiracy theory that the researchers deliberately failed to contact real skeptics for the study and then lied about it for some reason dr lewandowsky refuses to divulge which skeptical blogs he contacted wrote anthony watts who blogs on the popular climate skepticism website watts up with that though about 97 percent of working scientists agree that the evidence shows a warming trend caused by humans public understanding of climate change falls along political lines democrats are more likely to believe in global warming than republicans according to a 2011 report by the university of new hampshires carsey institute in fact deniers and skeptics who felt more confident in their climatechange knowledge were the strongest disbelievers 10 climate change myths busted believing that climate change isnt happening or that its not humancaused requires a belief that thousands of climate scientists around the world are lying outright lewandowsky and his colleagues wrote in their new paper conspiracy theory beliefs are known to come in clusters someone who thinks nasa faked the moon landing is more likely to accept the theory that 911 was an inside job for example so lewandowsky and his colleagues created an online survey and asked eight mostly proscience blogs and five climateskeptic blogs to post a link to the survey for their readers the respondents were selfselecting but highly motivated to care about climate science the researchers noted the responses came only from the eight proscience blogs the researchers reported of 1145 usable survey responses the researchers found that support for freemarket laissezfaire economics was linked to a rejection of climate change a tendency to believe other conspiracy theories was also linked to denial of climate change finally climatechange deniers were more likely than others to say that other environmental problems have been solved indicating a dismissive attitude toward green causes top 10 conspiracy theories unsurprisingly the results did not please climateskeptic bloggers some of whom responded by accusing lewandowsky of not attempting to contact them at all in an email to lucia liljegren who blogs at the blackboard lewandowsky declined to name the bloggers he emailed citing privacy concerns in response liljegren wrote i think who lewandowsky contacted will reveal whether he really even tried to conduct a balanced survey urging other bloggers to publically give permission for lewandowsky to reveal their names the researcher told desmogblog that he has contacted his universitys ethics committee to find out if he is allowed to do so in the meantime simon james who blogs at australian climate madness has submitted a freedom of information request to the university of western australia in an effort to force the release of emails related to the study and prominent climatechange skeptic steve mcintyre has urged readers to email the university with academic misconduct complaints mcintyre later reported that an email search turned up a request from one of lewandowskys collaborators to our knowledge our results are the first to provide empirical evidence for the correlation between a general construct of conspiracist ideation and the general tendency to reject wellfounded science lewandowsky and his colleagues concluded psychological research has found that conspiracy beliefs are hard to dislodge they wrote but

worldnews kabul reuters a suicide bomber blew himself up outside a voter registration center in the afghan capital kabul on sunday killing at least 57 people and injuring more than 100 in the most serious attack yet on preparations for elections scheduled for october islamic state claimed responsibility for the attack on a project of key importance to the credibility of president ashraf ghanis government which has been under international pressure to ensure longdelayed parliamentary polls take place this year interior ministry spokesman najib danesh said a bomber on foot approached the center where officials were issuing identity cards as part of the registration process for around 10 million voters across afghanistan registration began this month president ghani issued a statement condemning the attack and said it cannot divert us from our aims or weaken this national democratic process a spokesman for the ministry of public health said at least 57 people including eight children were confirmed dead and 119 wounded but the total could still rise the explosion destroyed cars and shattered windows in nearby buildings leaving rubble strewn across the bloodstained street it was the deadliest blast in kabul since about 100 people were killed in january by a bomb concealed in an ambulance and it came after repeated warnings that militants could try to disrupt the election process tadamichi yamamoto the senior united nations official in afghanistan issued a statement condemning the attack compounding the callous disregard for the lives of civilians the killing appears to be part of a wholly unacceptable effort by extremists to deter afghan citizens from carrying out their constitutional right to take part in elections he said after weeks of relative calm the blast took place in dashte barchi an area of western kabul inhabited by many members of the mainly shiite hazara minority which has been repeatedly hit by attacks claimed by islamic state there were women children everyone had come to get their identity cards said bashir ahmad who had been near the blast which occurred despite heightened security after the january attack according to un figures more than 750 people have been killed or maimed in suicide attacks and bombings by militant groups during the three months to march ahead of an expected start of the talibans usual spring offensive afghanistans international partners have insisted that the elections should be held this year before a presidential vote due in 2019 although there has been widespread scepticism that they will go ahead more than 7000 voter registration centers have been set up across afghanistan to handle about 10 million registrations in a process that has been repeatedly disrupted by technical and organizational problems officials had pledged tight security to ensure the process which will be vital to ensuring a ballot broadbased enough to be accepted as legitimate proceeded safely but those caught by sundays attack voiced frustration at what many kabul residents see as government shortcomings in securing the capital they should be keeping the country safe if they cant someone else should be in their place said sajeda who was wounded in the blast along with three other members of her family as they lined up for their cards the voter registration process designed to reduce the electoral fraud that has marred past ballots began this month but there have already been several security incidents on sunday a roadside bomb near a registration center in the northern city of puli khumri killed six members of a family and wounded three although there was no indication that the incident was directly linked to the kabul attack last week two police officers in the eastern city of jalalabad were killed outside a voter registration center while a voter center in the central province of ghor was burned down last week and electoral officials briefly abducted the vote could be postponed to next year if registration of voters many of whom do not have national identity cards is not completed before winter sets parliament is still sitting three years after its term officially

worldnews china and india just reminded the worldespecially those who have seen the slaughter in the killing fields in the middle east and africathat differences among people can be settled without firing a shot and without anyone getting killed the dispute began when china started to pave a road in a himalayan region at a plateau in doklam a territory china considers part of its land but india recognizes as part of the kingdom of bhutan its close ally india sent its troops to stop china and in turn china sent its troops to reinforce its claims the conflagration between the two nations each equipped with nuclear weapons and a large recently expanded military alarmed various observers indianborn economist and british politician meghnad desai claimed according to india today we could be in a full scale war with china within a month a new york times editorial painted a bleak scene of doklam as a ticking time bomb china and india two nucleararmed nations have come near the brink of conflict over an unpaved road now soldiers from the two powers are squaring off separated by only a few hundred feet the conflict shows no sign of abating and it reflects the swelling ambition and nationalism of both countries an oped in aljazeera similarly set a foreboding scene the two asian giants collectively home to a third of humanity are once again on the verge of direct military conflict with frightening implications for the region and beyond yet both indian and chinese troops left their firearms behind and instead jostled with each other in ways that are more reminiscent of a pickup basketball game or at worst a st patricks day street brannigan videos of these outbursts have regaled youtube viewers one video of a doklam skirmish shows roughly a dozen indian and chinese soldiers in heavy coats pushing each other around some simply charge with their chests holding their hands in the air to signal they dont want a fight others hold their foes in bear hugs no punches are thrown many of the soldiers wear cameras slung over their shoulders as each side seems eager to capture the other looking abusive another video which was aired on ndtv depicts a more heated confrontation at pangong lake in ladakh where some patrolmen wrestled punched kicked and hurled stones at each other altogether not a shot was fired not one was killed after two months of shoving and pushingthe two sides settled each framed the withdrawal of their troops from the contested area in their own terms but leave they did an indian foreign ministry official told the associated press that the two sides had agreed to return to the status quo and cable news channel ndtv reported that chinese bulldozers had been moved away and road construction stopped according to the washington post a chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said that china will continue to exercise its sovereign rights and guard its territorial sovereignty talk they did shoot they did not the issue may well flare up again and the road which the region needs may well be paved however for now this form of conflict resolution deserves much more attention than it is getting jostlingor my favorite arms wrestlingrecommends itself for parties that contest territories from iraq to sudan from libya to afghanistan some may say that this confrontation in bhutan was indeed an operatic one but we all know how aggressive china usually is indeed chinas foreign policy has often been described as aggressive by academics and pundits however in my 2017 book avoiding war with china i examined the major confrontations in which china has been involved in this century these include the senkakudiaoyu islands the scarborough shoal and the spratly islands in all these instances no one was killed not a shot was fired in some cases china lost it failed to change the status of the senkakudiaoyu islands in some it resolved the differences peacefully with the philippines over the spratly islands and in some the status remains unclear however without exception aggressionif this term applies at allwas largely verbal or amounted to some pushing and shoving ramming fishing boats and in one case roping off a shoal to impede the travel of some vessels into a chineseclaimed area we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your

health one of the biggest complaints you will hear from people during the day is how tired they are while lack of sleep can have many causes sharing a bed with a partner is linked to a decreased ability to sleep well but for many sharing a bed is a sacred part of the partnership mikel theobald recently shared some great tips on how to sleep better when sharing a bed but aside from getting a new mattress or taking to separate bedrooms here are some suggestions that might cost you less money and keep you and your loved one together while it is gorgeous to see a kingsized bed decked out in a fabulous comforter that single blanket can become a battle ground in the middle of the night as one partner rolls over taking all the blankets with them instead of making your bed with one large comforter try two twinsize comforters and twinsized top sheets with each spouse safely wrapped in their own blanket they can choose to tug roll or fling off those linens as they see fit without disturbing their partner in the process with separate blankets you are also able to tailor the warmth level to each partners needs while many alarms clocks today come with a setting for two alarms make the investment and install an alarm clock on each side of the bed each partner can then easily reach and use it without disturbing the other you may also want to experiment with using the lowest volume setting that will wake you up instead of blaring the clock loudly for all to hear sometimes sleeping better together is about etiquette ear plugs ear plugs are a savior for people sleeping with snorers or latenight television habits the key to using ear plugs successfully is making sure that they fit you and that you replace them frequently experiment with several brands andor styles until you find the ones that fit your ears comfortably and block out sound then remember that most ear plugs are designed as singleuse products while you can use each pair for a bit longer than that they do wear out and become less effective when you start to hear the snoring again swap out a new pair also you may find that your ears are two different sizes or of different sensitivities to hearing or the plug shape you may need to create your own hybrid pair from two different styles for maximum quiet and restful sleep getting sleep has been linked to so many measures of improved health that you owe it to yourself and your loved one to create bedroom that works to support your individual sleeping habits as much as you can

social dr thomas mcgovern became the eighth president of bostonbased fisher college in 2007 after 28 years of teaching students at the institution mcgovern joined the school 38 years ago as an adjunct professor having already built a successful career in the field of transportation management where he served as the former governors representative for highway safety as well as the executive director of the massachusetts governors highway safety bureau passionate about education and an ardent believer in earning degrees across multiple complementary disciplines mcgovern holds a bachelors of science from northeastern university a masters degree of public administration from suffolk universitys sawyer school of management and a doctorate of education in leadership from johnson and wales university hes a naturalborn teacher an innovator a veteran a sports fan and a proud grandfather i recently sat down with mcgovern to find out what it takes to retain an everyoneknowsyourname school culture while keeping pace and in some instances outpacing most other colleges in yearoveryear growth in admissions while remaining relevant as an institution in a highly competitive educational market like boston here are dr thomas mcgoverns four simple strategies for being the change you wish to see in business and in life seize the opportunity to lead when the opening for president of fisher college became available in 2007 mcgovern says it was at a time in his life when he should have been considering his retirement options especially because it was the same year in which his wife was retiring however he had been teaching at the school for more than 28 years and as a faculty member its easy to sit back and be critical of whats happening in the school he says that in life its fine if you want to constantly give your two cents about how things could be better but you better be ready to seize the opportunity to make things better if the occasion is presented as inviting as the idea of retirement was at the time mcgovern says to him there was really nothing more exciting than being part of the solution to making fisher college stronger more competitive and more culturally diverse than it already was so he threw his hat in the ring as a candidate for the position upon being selected for the role he first went to work on the budget deficit the school faced for the current fiscal year and not only did he and his team eliminate the deficit they turned a profit that year with the help of his leadership team during the past nine years they have transformed the executive team now suggesting each member have a mba to support their education credentials have increased enrollment by more than 100 percent and have gone from one baccalaureate degree in 2007 to now offering 10 bachelors programs and an mba in strategic leadership with an additional three anticipated mcgovern says that with all things in life you have a right to be critical as long as you seize the opportunity to lead the change when the opportunity presents itself just as he did when the time was right at fisher college innovate mcgovern says that when it comes to being part of the solution you must be willing to constantly poll others for advice and ideas mcgovern spends a considerable amount of time speaking with students staff and faculty always looking for innovative solutions to improve the school he says that there are plenty of larger universities and colleges in the area that can solve problems simply with money but fisher college is always very budget conscious which means its absolutely necessary to seek new and different ideas from the people who have a vested interest in the success of the school the faculty staff and students mcgovern says that in order to do this you have to make sure everyone feels comfortable enough to voice their opinions he says that the school prides itself on their everyoneknowsyourname culture and so mcgovern plants himself firmly in the trenches so that he gets to know everyone on movein day at the college mcgovern along with staff and faculty shows up ready to help families move their students into the dorms as well mcgovern steps in to teach an occasional class so he can get to know students he says that innovation requires a culture where everyone feels comfortable providing input and making contributions coupled with a leadership team interested in remaining at the forefront of change find your passion mcgovern began teaching at fisher college 38 years ago when he joined as an adjunct professor teaching evening classes in business management and finance by day he was juggling a successful career in transportation management so why take on an evening position according to mcgovern he wanted to do something he enjoyed and wanted to make a difference as a result he landed in front of a classroom of students many of whom were vietnamera veterans as a veteran of the united states army mcgovern said it was his ability to relate to his fellow veterans that made it an easy decision to begin teaching mcgovern says hes living his purpose by growing and improving the college while touching the lives of hundreds of students each year in fact mcgovern feels that if anyone looks closely at what they do when theres nothing else to do theres a good chance they will find their true passion and purpose in life he says he feels fortunate that his passion for teaching and his affinity for the college is as much a part of who he is as his dna and turned into a lifelong career that has provided fulfillment challenge and personal growth resonate when the position for president of fisher college became available in 2007 mcgovern knew he would apply he immediately went to work refining his resume and when it was complete he was looking at a multipage report listing years of service in teaching conference presentations publications and transportation management as he read through the resume he noted that it was so full of career accolades that his passion for the school didnt come through in other words he says his resume didnt resonate and so he stripped it of all that didnt matter and handed in an abbreviated version which listed his work at the school his professor of the year award from 2001 his 100 percent attendance record at the fisher college basketball games in 2005 and that he was the 1990 commencement speaker what he hoped to convey was his undying spirit and commitment to the college while eliminating all that didnt matter the lesson explained mcgovern is that when youre going after any type of big job huge opportunity or massive dream its vitally important to step into the shoes of the decision maker to determine what matters to them and then craft your message with that in mind mcgovern says its all about the simple art of catching peoples attention because when you do you and your message resonate and you achieve your goal being that mcgovern is a sports fan my time with him reminded me of a famous michael jordan quote some people want it to happen some wish it would happen others make it happen dr thomas mcgovern has spent more than half his life touching the lives of those who walk through the doors of bostonbased fisher college instead of wishing for change in the world he is making change and the formula he shares with others is simple seize the opportunity to lead innovate find your passion and resonate hes thomas mcgovern a leader in change

economy while his genius may be largely uncontested mark zuckerbergs vision of facebook is badly adrift from reality he paints the social media behemoth he founded in 2004 as a tool to bring the world closer together but in many ways it has become an indispensable amplification device for people who want to make it known that they hate other people testifying before congress last wednesday zuckerberg declared we do not allow hate groups on facebook overall as with many things the facebook ceo said during his trip to the hill last week it was difficult to square this statement with the actual experience of using facebook angry observers were quick to point to antimuslim antisemitic antirohingya antilgbtq and other hateful groups actively operating on the platform zuckerbergs claim hit a nerve for me as well two months ago a private facebook group devoted to altright trump memes inaugurated a campaign of sexual harassment against me when alerted to the situation facebooks response was essentially on feb 13 i awoke to find a stream of friend requests on facebook and a startling message from a man i did not know there is some random weirdo posting pictures of you he sent me a screenshot of a photo posted in the private facebook group emperor trumps dank meme stash which had more than 72000 members at the time there i was standing on the beach in oahu wearing shorts a bikini top and a cardigan i loved that photo it was a reminder of a day spent hiking and swimming with my family during our first vacation together in years i posted it on facebook last april i was stunned as i stared at it almost a year later along with my full name literally hundreds of comments and a caption that read this is going to be a hard one guys huffington post reporter smash or pass immediately i requested permission to join the closed group and was directed to answer two questions for approval by its administrators where do you fall on the cuck spectrum and are you a normie i turned back to the man who had alerted me to the photo and asked him to send me screenshots of as many of the responses as possible so i could email them to the appropriate representatives at facebook as is common in the publishing industry huffpost and facebook work closely on products partnerships and other shared objectives it is a lot of comments he warned none of them are nice its difficult to describe how it feels to discover hundreds of complete strangers debating how fuckable you are or to see them casually suggest theyd like to smash pump and skullfuck you as an apparent form of punishment for your gender and job title dozens of my friends and coworkers reported the group to facebook several hours later facebook responded to them with a message saying it had discovered content that doesnt follow our community standards it added we removed that specific content instead of the entire group but subsequent screenshots showed my photo was still there a staff manager at huffpost also contacted facebook directly to request that the post be taken down as quickly as possible his message contained the screenshots of comments and stressed the matters urgency two days later a representative followed up and asked him for the link to the post with the photo which was inaccessible to anyone who did not belong to the private group and which i had failed to obtain from the growing swarm of trolls in my inbox the facebook representative said that without the link not much could be done so the harassment continued and it worsened as my account was flooded with creepy messages and friend requests now 890 and counting one of my colleagues wrote a public facebook post asking others to report the group hoping that it might expedite the process of getting my picture removed soon enough the trolls found her profile too well just post your pic and do a smash or pass one man wrote on her status below two other nasty comments another appeared in her inbox smash it was clear that she was also being targeted in emperor trumps dank meme stash she deactivated her account my photo remained posted in the group for at least six days long enough for it to garner even more attention and be shared to at least three other pages so after nearly a week of apparent inaction from facebook i got in touch with one of the groups administrators who can review reports about members posts remove content and revoke membership as they please he told me that the picture might have flown under the radar dont blame me he said after assuring me he had taken the photo down blame facebook for their stupid reporting system when i asked him to let me join the group so i could see for myself that it was gone he refused with a growing network of more than 2 billion users around the globe facebooks role in shaping the way we communicate online cannot be easily overstated it has public policies in place to penalize those who violate its community standards including posts containing nudity hate speech and violent or graphic content these users may have their content removed or their accounts disabled or may even be reported to law enforcement moderating hate speech is an issue that we struggle with continuously zuckerberg said last week theres a lot of content flowing through the systems and a lot of reports and unfortunately we dont always get these things right when people report it to us he vowed that facebook would have more than 20000 people working on security and content review across the company by the end of the year acknowledging that no amount of people that we can hire will be enough to review all of the content but instead of advocating for more moderators pundits have long been calling for greater transparency surrounding the organizations internal content review standards to ensure consistent enforcement and accountability a plea many say has fallen on deaf ears a guardian investigation into leaked documents from facebook including private guidelines for content moderation revealed last year that phrases like to snap a bitchs neck make sure to apply all your pressure to the middle of her throat are allowed while others like someone shoot trump are not the report noted that moderators often have just 10 seconds to make a decision when evaluating material it also said many have concerns about the inconsistency and peculiar nature of some of the policies especially those regarding sexual content experts have cautioned that inadequate moderation practices can have serious consequences such as fostering a culture of online impunity leading sites like facebook to become breeding grounds and safe havens for harassment whereas trolls used to work under the cover of relative anonymity on sites like 4chan and reddit many of the facebook users who commented on my photo and sent me grotesque messages astonishingly felt comfortable enough to do so using their real profiles with their real names photos locations and even places of employment listed alejandra who works at a debtrelief company in fresno california commented smash with a ballgag so she doesnt speak ironically in a public bio statement sitting atop her facebook profile she has written i dont care who you are if you are kind to me i will be kind to you its that simple michael a new yorkbased account manager who was previously a cadet first lieutenant at a military academy in pennsylvania wrote that he would smash but ill unload on her face for the patriarch on his professional website he lists his favorite bible verse as psalm 133 how good and pleasant it is when gods people live together in unity far from promoting unity facebook is an ideal ecosystem for hate groups to flourish during zuckerbergs appearances on the hill last week much was made of his sites explosive growth and transformation but from my vantage point staring at screenshots from emperor trumps dank meme stash facebook looks remarkably unevolved a platform that grew out of a hot or not womenranking site is now a place for users to debate smash or pass upon receiving a request for comment for this article on friday two months after huffpost initially alerted facebook to the situation the organization said it would review emperor trumps dank meme stash by days end the group was taken down as groups evolve we can evaluate their activity over time a spokesperson said in a statement that evening we have removed this group for violating our policies a revival page is up and running with nearly 7000 members free speech does not exist here its description reads blame

health trust is the lubricant for all relationships people are perpetually evaluating our trustworthiness when we have their trust we move through things quickly we make progress but once we lose someones trust we attach a slowing weight to the possibility of ever making progress some people may be more trusting than others but regardless of whom you are dealing with here are seven ways to lose trust 1be selfish the more you pursue your selfinterest the less i can ever believe that youll take mine into consideration and if you arent looking out for me then how could i ever trust you 2be protective true trust reciprocates yet if there is something that you have that you are holding onto as yours then that means it will never be ours which means we arent sharing and we arent in this together if you want my heart or my money you need to first share yours 3be ungrateful granting someone the gift of your trust is a demonstration of incredibly vulnerability and there is no faster way to cause someone to close off their heart to you then when you dont acknowledge their gifts and at least their attempts to satisfy you 4be selfcentered selfish means keeping things to yourself but selfcentered means thinking only of yourself neither one works for building trust because if we are going to have trust then i need to know that you are considering my point of view and how the impacts of your choices will affect me trusting a selfcentered person is a voided oneway street 5be passive aggressive having an issue and not confronting me on it directly isnt grace its betrayal betrayal is the opposite of trust trust isnt developed from the absence of conflict but from developing a healthy process for resolving it show me you have the courage to work through our problems and youll always have my trust 6be negative if you know someone is always looking at the down side then its hard to think that theyll ever give you the benefit of the doubt or that theyll support you and your dreams which is why negativity directly destroys our willingness to have faith in another you can choose to be negative or you can choose to have my trust but you cant have both 7be incongruent the foundation of trust is strong integrity it is seeing someone live out and execute the things they say they will do over and over and over again a person with integrity is a person that can be counted on because once they tell you theyre going to do something its as good as done always follow through and dont forget that every word and every promise matters trust is the great accelerator to all of lifes missions it is the explanation of extraordinary success between two people and the root cause of monumental failure between two others there is no replacement for trust and no easy way to get it back once youve lost it trust me rory vaden mba is cofounder of southwestern consulting selfdiscipline strategist and speaker and new york times bestselling author of take the stairs southwestern consulting httpwwwsouthwesternconsultingcom self discipline strategist httpwwwroryvadencom take the stairs httpwwwtakethestairsbookcom

worldnews aid workers pulled more than 1000 migrants and refugees from nine floundering vessels in distress off the libyan coast on thursday in another intense day for the italian coast guard and humanitarian organizations operating searchandrescue missions in the mediterranean sea the crews of proactiva open arms a spanish aid organization involved in thursdays operations said they had evacuated two rubber dinghies and a wooden boat each crammed with more than 130 men women and children a 2monthold baby with asthma was among the passengers of another wooden vessel intercepted that day together with the italian coast guard humanitarian organizations like proactiva doctors without borders and save the children are the only actors now running proactive rescue missions in the mediterranean as the number of migrants and refugees attempting to reach europe reached new highs in the past few months nongovernmental organizations have come under fierce criticism from european politicians and officials who accuse them of hampering efforts to stem the influx the ngos are almost like a ferry service its almost as if the smugglers were putting people directly on ngo boats an anonymous european official told reuters last month but new research that the goldsmiths university of london released last week argues that empirical analysis systematically refutes some of the main accusations leveled against humanitarian groups this report is written to avert a looming catastrophe the researchers say if ngos are forced to stop or reduce their operations many more lives will be lost to the sea on october 3 2013 more than 300 migrants and refugees drowned in a shipwreck off the italian island of lampedusa the tragedy prompted italy to launch mare nostrum a coast guard search and rescue mission that has been credited with saving tens of thousands of lives when mare nostrum came to an end in 2014 the european border agency frontex launched a new operation in its place rather than focusing on searchandrescue however the main goal of the frontex operation was border protection on april 12 and april 15 2015 more than 1200 people perished in two shipwrecks off the italian coast many of the victims had been trapped in the vessels hull after they capsized in the absence of a dedicated european searchandrescue operation and confronted with a growing loss of migrants lives at sea humanitarian organizations launched their own rescue efforts coordinated by the italian coast guard in 2016 a deal between turkey and the european union effectively closed the balkan route across the aegean sea the libyan coast all but lawless amid the security vacuum following the fall of leader muammar gaddafi was fertile ground for smugglers and criminal networks the large number of boats intercepted on thursday was no rare occurrence in the past few months a staggering number of migrants and refugees attempted the 70miles crossing from libya to italy more than 65000 migrants and refugees have arrived in italy since january 2017 up 18 percent on the same period last year at least 1735 people have died trying to reach europe this year many more are believed to have perished while making their way across sub saharan africa to the libyan coast faced with a growing number of arrivals critics of the humanitarian organizations have argued in recent months that the searchandrescue missions create a pull factor for migrants and refugees you are stimulating smuggling said belgiums secretary for migration theo francken blaming doctors without borders in a heated twitter exchange in march your rescue operations close to the coast create a pullfactor and thus more deaths he added to the agency also known by its french acronym msf but goldsmiths researchers say that rather than the rescue missions worsening economic and political conditions across the african continent including the militant group boko harams reign of terror in nigeria and conflict and poverty in the horn of africa have motivated migrants and refugees to attempt the dangerous journey those factors pushed migrants to the libyan coast far before the searchandrescue missions intensified in addition the researchers say worsening violence in libya has left many migrants with little choice but to attempt the crossing whether rescue missions were operating or not if ngos are forced to stop or reduce their operations many more lives will be lost to the sea the goldsmiths report also disputes a second allegation leveled at the aid organizations collusion with smugglers in february a controversial prosecutor on the italian island of sicily launched a factfinding investigation into ties between the humanitarian groups and libyan smugglers three months later carmelo zuccaro said in court he had found no evidence proving the hypothesis while far more measured in his analysis the head of frontex echoed a related sentiment when telling reuters in may that rescue efforts should be careful not to encourage smuggling operations we have to strike the right balance between saving lives and making sure our actions dont fuel a criminal businessby encouraging criminals to adapt their modus operandi to the fact that there will be vessels approaching libya fabrice leggeri said ngos like doctors without borders argue that when faced with people at risk of dying aid workers cannot hesitate to respond lets be clear when you see boats like this in the mediterranean you have only two options you rescue them or you rescue them msf tweeted on june 9 humanitarian organizations carrying out search and rescue at sea are saving tens of thousands of people from drowning every year humanitarian action is not the cause of this crisis but is a response to it msf told huffpost in a statement lets be clear when you see people on boats like this in the mediterranean you have only two options you rescue them or you rescue them pictwittercomgnr7kxok2d frontex spokeswoman izabella cooper stressed in an email that the agency had never accused aid organizations of colluding with people smugglers frontexdeployed vessels have helped save tens of thousands of lives she added the agency said that its analyses had shown that smugglers have been loading far more people into the rickety boats the quality of the vessels has decreased dramatically in recent years and migrants and refugees were given just enough food and fuel to make it outside libyas territorial waters far short of whats needed to reach the italian coast in the past two years the smugglers in libya have changed their modus operandi and have become more ruthless cooper told huffpost in an email while critics of the aid organizations operations point to those worsening conditions to argue that searchandrescue missions close to the libyan coast in the long run endanger migrants lives the goldsmiths researchers say that the crossing has become more dangerous because of the worsening violence in libya since the end of 2016 the researchers say smuggling operations have increasingly been led by militias and that shift contributed to a change in the smugglers methods additionally the researchers argue one of the reasons smugglers shifted from using safer wooden vessels to rubber boats was the eus own practice of destroying migrant vessels we argue that sar ngos responded to and were not the cause of these evolving practices that had instead been spurred by other processes and actors predating sar ngos intervention the researchers write msf argues that policies largely focused on antismuggling and stemming the influx of migrants and refugees are ineffective and dont do enough to reduce migrant death at sea we remain committed to providing you with

shocked to see that eu investment at sea is mainly focused on deterrence and surveillance and that there is no mandate of proactive sar msf said finally the report argues migrant deaths in the mediterranean have been on the rise since early 2016 before aid organizations stepped up their missions in the mediterranean migrant deaths declined after the ngo ships deployed and rose again when the search and rescue missions decreased there is thus a striking negative correlation between the decreasing mortality rate and the rising number of sar ngo vessels which shows that the latter made the crossing safer the researchers wrote
politics attorneys for former president donald trump have filed an updated motion regarding the fbis confiscation of government documents from his maralago estate after a judge ordered them to restructure it the 12page motion filed in a federal court in florida on friday night asks for the appointment of a neutral special master to review the documents taken from trumps resort earlier this month to determine if any may be protected by executive privilege the filing was characterized as supplemental to an initial motion presented earlier this week it was newly filed on the same day that another court released the affidavit supporting the fbis aug 8 search friday nights motion does not mention the hundreds of pages of classified documents seized during the search and other visits by investigators politico noted it also fails to mention trumps insistence that he declassified all the material before it was taken from the white house a claim that he and ally kash patel the former chief of staff to trumps acting defense secretary have made repeatedly the motion cites a 1991 court decision concerning electronic communication which determined that neither congress nor the national archives can veto a sitting presidents disposal decision regarding official records the judgment doesnt however address issues concerning former presidents nor does it say anything about certain legal violations around stashing white house records without the proper authority politico pointed out trumpappointed judge aileen cannon on tuesday criticized the original motion for failing to answer several of her questions and gave attorneys until friday to answer them she even supplied a link to a sample motion that they could consult the boxes that fbi agents took from maralago this month included 11 packets of classified material some of it top secret under the presidential records act of 1978 such documents must be turned over to the national archives when a president leaves office several legal experts appeared unimpressed with the updated motion in a tweet appellate attorney ted boutrous called it very weak the crux of this motiona request for a special master to keep materials subject to executive privilege away from the executive branchremains nonsensical tweeted former federal prosecutor renato mariotti and even if this motion is granted it doesnt move the ball forward for trump we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again very weak very moot httpstcouuchbxwqla the crux of this motiona request for a special master to keep materials subject to executive privilege away from the executive branchremains nonsensical and even if this motion is granted it doesnt move the ball forward for trump httpstcopefsdbbog2

health though frenzied is the only word i can think of to effectively describe activity on the upper east side of manhattan the first saturday night after hurricane sandys visit i suspect that beneath the hyperactivity generated by residents and visitors from neighboring areas was a profound sense of relief from the suspense uncertainty and fear that in various degrees gripped many of us for most of the past week just knowing that light and tv were emerging was sufficient cause for gratitude and celebration during the storm and in the wake of devastation safe and secure in my apartment which blessedly retained its electricity the wwii anthem coming in on a wing and a prayer harold adamson and jimmie mchugh entered my consciousness a reminder of those wartorn days the analogy was reinforced by a saturday morning channel 7 program hosted by charismatic weatherman sam champion called sea rescue focusing on the plight and rehabilitation of wildlife the subject was a brown pelican whose wings had been punctured by telephone wires this creature had hung upside down for three days it was rescued by the fire department then nursed back to health in an openair facility where when well enough to fly it could just take off and resume its life coming in on a wing and a prayer echoes the emotions of the many courageous souls whose courage kept them afloat during sandys assault of water and wind i recalled stories of wartime pilots who were guided to safety by angels even if these claims are anecdotal they illustrate the undeniable power of the strength of the human spirit and faith in divine protection to overcome seeminglyinsurmountable obstacles one of the most powerful prayers of protection in scriptures is psalm 91 because of the dire and desperate conditions that prevailed at this time threatening the very survival of individuals and institutions too broken to fix here is this psalm in its entirety taken from the king james translation of the bible 1 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty 2 i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress in him will i trust 3 surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence 4 he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler 5 thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day 6 nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday 7 a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee 8 only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked 9 because thou has made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation 10 there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling 11 for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways 12 they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone 13 thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet 14 because he hath set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he hath known my name 15 he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him 16 with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation there are multitudes on earth today who empathize identify with the plight of that pelican and its forlorn chances for survival against all odds its creator brought it to safety allowing it to fulfill its divine purpose of catching more fish can you really believe that we are loved less by the lord for more on emotional wellness click here
technology we all know the struggle youre vegging out on the couch eyes on your favorite netflix show hand tight around a halfempty craft brew the last thing you want to do is get up and get yourself another beer now imagine you can get a robot to fetch you a beer while you stay comfortably seated on the couch thats exactly the idea behind beerbots a team of robots developed by researchers at the computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory csail at the massachusetts institute of technology heres the big bartender bot which stays behind the bar and waits for the little waiter robots to deliver peoples drink orders for their experiments the mit researchers turned their laboratory into a testing ground where the two small robowaiters called turtlebots could roam freely the turtlebots which resembled coolers on wheels traveled back and forth from the bar to rooms where people were sitting and theyd take drink orders from the human participants when someone requested a beer a turtlebot traveled to a third machine the large robot bartender which supplied the beverage then the turtlebot delivered the beer to the person the beerbots used algorithms to plan reason and fill the orders in addition each turtlebot had to determine which orders were requested in which room and when the other turtlebot had delivered drinks said mit communications coordinator adam connersimons in a statement about the project heres the big robobartender placing a drink into the cooleronwheels turtlebot which then delivers it to the person who ordered it the project was the brainchild of chris amato a former csail postdoctoral researcher who is now a professor at the university of new hampshire amato worked with a team of mit professors postdocs and graduate students to develop the beerbots which were presented in july at the annual robotics science and systems conference as you might guess coordinating a team of robots to deliver beer is far from easy in a recent paper the mit researchers detailed some of the issues they faced in the experiment including navigation problems unpredictable outcomes and communication between robots and humans each robots sensors get lessthanperfect information about the location and status of both themselves and the things around them amato said per mit news as for outcomes a robot may drop items when trying to pick them up or take longer than expected to navigate and on top of that robots often are not able to communicate with one another either because of communication noise or because they are out of range anticipating these difficulties the mit researchers programmed the robots with complex planning algorithms which allowed the machines to engage in higherlevel reasoning about their location status and behavior similarly to they way humans perform tasks in other words the beerbots were aware of their neighbors and could adjust to several possible situations almost all realworld problems have some form of uncertainty baked into them said amato according to mit news as a result there is a huge range of areas where these planning approaches could be of help sure enough these planning algorithms have applications beyond bartending for instance amato and his collaborators are currently testing the algorithms with robots employed in simulated searchandrescue scenarios lorenzo ligato covers technology and internet culture and is based in new york you can contact him at lorenzoligatohuffingtonpostcom or on twitter lorenzowrites
health reuters health people who eat a lot of saturated fat the bad kind of fat thats abundant in foods like butter and beef are more likely to develop lung cancer than individuals on lowfat diets a recent study suggests compared to adults who didnt get a lot of fat in their diets people who ate the most total fat and saturated fat were 14 percent more likely to get lung malignancies the study found for current and former smokers the added risk of a high fat diet was 15 percent while the best way to lower the risk of lung cancer is to not smoke a healthy diet may also help reduce lung cancer risk said study coauthor danxia yu of vanderbilt university medical center in nashville tennessee specifically our findings suggest that increasing polyunsaturated fat intake while reducing saturated fat intake especially among smokers and recent quitters may help prevent not only cardiovascular disease but also lung cancer she said the american heart association recommends the dietary approaches to stop hypertension dash diet or a mediterraneanstyle diet to help prevent cardiovascular disease both diets emphasize cooking with vegetable oils with unsaturated fats eating nuts fruits vegetables lowfat dairy products whole grains fish and poultry and limiting red meat and added sugars and salt those guidelines are the same for avoiding heart disease stroke and diabetes and i would say they are also exactly the same for helping with cancer prevention in general and lung cancer in particular said dr nathan berger a researcher at case western reserve university and university hospitals cleveland medical center who wasnt involved in the study this doesnt mean you need to throw away all the steak and butter in your freezer but cutting back to once a week would be good for you berger said in a phone interview for the current study researchers examined data from 10 previously published studies in the united states europe and asia that looked at how dietary fat intake influences the odds of lung malignancies combined the smaller studies had more than 14 million participants including 18822 with cases of lung cancer identified during an average followup of more than nine years researchers sorted participants into five categories from lowest to highest consumption of total and saturated fats they also sorted participants into five groups ranging from the lowest to highest amounts of dietary unsaturated fats overall people who ate the most unsaturated fats were 8 percent less likely to develop lung cancer than people who ate the least amounts researchers report in the journal of clinical oncology substituting five percent of calories from saturated fat with unsaturated fat was associated with a 16 percent lower risk of small cell lung cancer and 17 percent lower odds of another type of lung malignancy known as squamous cell carcinoma one limitation of the study is that dietary information was only obtained at one point the authors note this makes it impossible to track how changes in eating habits might influence the odds of cancer they also didnt account for two other things that may contribute to cancer sugar and trans fats glen lawrence a biochemistry researcher at long island university in brooklyn new york said by email previous research has also found that unsaturated oils may increase the risk of certain cancers added lawrence who wasnt involved in the current study its also possible that other bad eating habits not fat contribute to the increased risk of lung cancer said ursula schwab of the institute of public health and clinical nutrition at the university of eastern finland in kuopio we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we need antioxidants vitamins and minerals as well as unsaturated fatty acids schwab who wasnt involved in the study said by email a typical western diet has a low content of these essential nutrients and a high content of saturated fat source bitly2wszteb journal of clinical oncology online july 25 2017
technology the boroughs of new york city the bronx brooklyn manhattan queens and staten island have existed in their present form since the consolidation of new york city in 1898 in the interim 119 years the city has radically transformed the individual boroughs are now interconnected in ways that would have been unimaginable at the time of their formation a vast network of bridges tunnels and the largest rapid transit system in the world connect the populations establishments and institutions of each borough to say nothing of the connections enabled by the explosion of digital and mobile technologies in this article we explore what happens when we abandon this centuryold partitioning and remap the city to reflect the realities of new york city in 2017 using data from dozens of different sources and techniques from a wide range of technologies and disciplines including computer vision natural language processing statistics machine learning network science topology architecture and urbanism we constructed a new partitioning of the city that resonates with our contemporary moment 5 boroughs for the 21st century map of new york city boroughs 1898 source david rumsey map collection when new york city was consolidated in 1898 forming a city of 34 million the term borough was adopted to describe the five constituent areas brought together under the consolidation each borough was represented by a borough president an elected officer who sat on the new york city board of estimate an 8member governing body responsible for budget and landuse decisions which also included the mayor the comptroller and the president of the new york city council verrazanonarrows bridge 1964 bronxwhitestone bridge 1939 the henry hudson bridge 1936 source mta flickr with the exception of queensbrooklyn all boroughs are separated from one another by water the implications and limitations of this physical partitioning of land have changed considerably since the initial formation of the boroughs new york city is now connected by over 2000 bridges and tunnels the vast majority of which were built after 1898 city hall station one of the first stations opened by the interborough rapid transit subway irt photo by fred guenther the formation of the boroughs also predated the opening of the new york city subway system by 6 years the ambition to connect the boroughs of nyc via subway was made clear in the naming of the first subway company to operate in the city the interborough rapid transit company from its first day of operation when it transported over 150000 passengers to its current status as the busiest rapid transit rail system in the western world the new york city subway has had a radical impact on the life of new york city and the mobility of its denizens disenfranchisement of the boroughs as a unit in 1989 the supreme court unanimously declared the nyc board of estimate to be unconstitutional this decision was made on the grounds that brooklyn pop 2504706 according to the 2010 census had no greater representation than staten island pop 468730 thereby violating the fourteenth amendments equal protection clause in the wake of this decision the nyc board of estimate was abolished and most of its governing responsibilities were transferred to the new york city council which consists of members drawn from a much more granular partitioning of the city with 51 council districts distributed unevenly across the 5 boroughs thus while the constituent council districts of a borough have substantial political power in the new york city government via their representative council members the boroughs as a unit have far less political significance the topos platform allows clustering using a range of values for k it also allows user to change the set of inputs that power the clustering we formed topos earlier this year to advance the understanding of cities through the interconnected lenses of data and artificial intelligence while there are wellknown tools such as the united states census that use manual techniques to collect information about different locations using data and ai enables a dynamic highly granular and globally scalable understanding of place an understanding we think is valuable given the rapidly evolving nature of cities and neighborhoods around the world the us census for example takes place every 10 years divides the country into 9 regions and only covers the us furthermore we were interested in going beyond more familiar demographic viewpoints to capture the personality of a place and what it feels like to actually be there in a sense weve developed a psychographics of neighborhoods as part of this endeavor we have constructed a suite of features and indices about neighborhoods and cities that encompasses everything from topological analysis of urban form to ambient light levels to the prevalence of craft cocktails within a neighborhood from this starting point we decided to reenvision what a five borough partitioning of nyc might look like in 2017 using techniques from artificial intelligence vector construction dimensionality reduction and clustering looking at our new 5 borough mapping of new york one thing is immediately clear geographic boundaries and proximities are much less important than they were in the original boroughs with the exception of the green cluster all other clusters are spread across a minimum of 3 of the original geographically defined boroughs and divided by at least one body of water there is also a clear pattern of concentric rings radiating from downtown manhattan despite the fact that we didnt include commute time or distance to transport hubs as an input in this sense geography reasserts itself as an organizing principle of the new boroughs on average we find the following distances to the center of downtown manhattan average distances to the center of downtown manhattan this striking pattern of concentric differentiated rings resonates with the formal organization of ernest burgess urban land use model though it differs in the specific substance of the concentric rings alongside commuter distance explicit economic indicators such as income housing and rental prices were not included in our input data despite this there are clear dramatic differences that emerge when economic data is aggregated to the cluster level with the median household income of cluster 1 101555 usd almost triple that of cluster 4 35828 usd given the intertwined nature of commute time and income inequality it is perhaps unsurprising that capturing one of these factors implies the other heavily built up vertical borough highest establishment density the smallest of the new boroughs as measured by both population and area minhattan is also the densest in several regards in addition to being the most densely populated with 69k residentssquare mile minhattan has a higher density of most types of establishments from museums to nightclubs than any other borough alongside this incredible commercial institutional and population density there is a corresponding absence of the natural world while the collection of neighborhoods brought together in minhattan are tightly bound by geography it is also interesting to consider the closeby neighborhoods that are excluded in particular riverside south trump place stands apart from minhattan for a more indepth discussion of the singular nature or riverside south within the context of manhattans westside see our article rethinking distance in new york city the ring tightly hugs minhattan and on average is the closest borough to the center of minhattan with housing prices to match after minhattan it is the most expensive borough to buy a house in unlike minhattan the ring spans multiple rivers it also unites isolated neighborhoods embedded in other boroughs that are quite far from the center of the ring such as forest hills inwood and hudson heights in general the ring has high densities across a range of establishments and is the second densest borough after minhattan half of nycs residents live in north bend and south bend with 276 of the population living in the north bend and 226 in the south bend they share remarkably similar average distances to downtown manhattan with south bend neighborhoods an average of 792 miles away and north bend neighborhoods an average of 786 miles away north bend is more densely populated than south bend 46694 residentssquare mile vs 33367 residents per square mile which may explain another aspect of what differentiates them south bend has a far higher frequency of noise and party complaints typical photos taken from the meadows nature and suburban style homes are frequent subjects the meadows is farthest away from the heart of minhattan and is sparser than the rest of the city in every regard there are 12050 people per square mile vs minhattans 69390 a nearly 600 increase coupled with this lack of urban density the natural environment asserts itself more strongly in the meadows a feature we detect using image recognition technologies additionally image recognition algorithms discern the frequent presence of traditional suburban style houses in the meadows revealing a side of new york city that is less frequently presented in depictions of the city as with many new technologies data and ai based partitioning can be used to both positive and negative ends enabling a new level of strategic gerrymandering and malapportionment is an undeniable risk we also believe the cultural ecological institutional and architectural diversity of new york city is an incredible strength and should be celebrated at the same time understanding how groups of neighborhoods are connected by a common set of challenges environmental conditions spatial configurations or cultures enables a more informed granular approach to the city whether this means developing strategies to address noise pollution deciding where to open a farmers market or finding an apartment we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone

diminution of political power within the new york city government the boroughs of new york are semantic units that powerfully shape the way many people perceive the city not to mention the rest of the world at the least we hope this datadriven partitioning challenges static simplifications of what the bronx brooklyn manhattan queens or staten island means new york city has changed radically over the past 119 years and will continue to do so as will cities across the world in this regard we end with a correction of the title rather than 5 boroughs for the 21st century a more appropriately dynamic title would be 5 boroughs for june 19th 2017 this post is an abbreviation of an article originally published on medium as a part of an ongoing series capturing different insights we generate

worldnews ankara reuters president donald trump is not fit for his job the speaker of irans parliament said on wednesday following his decision to back out of the international nuclear pact on iran trump pulled the united states out of the deal on tuesday raising the risk of conflict in the middle east upsetting european allies and casting uncertainty over global oil supplies trump does not have the mental capacity to deal with issues parliament speaker ali larijani told the assembly broadcast live on state tv iranian lawmakers set fire to the us flag inside the countrys parliament following president trumps decision to withdraw from the iran nuclear agreement httpstcouncr2fapp1 pictwittercomkm4ifsxoum members of parliament burned a us flag and a symbolic copy of the iran deal known officially as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa as a session of parliament began they also chanted death to america trumps abandoning of the nuclear deal was a diplomatic showiran has no obligation to honor its commitments under the current situation larijani said it is obvious that trump only understands the language of force general mohammad baqeri the chief of staff of irans military said iran had not had to sign the deal but that arrogant country america did not even stand by its signature the islamic republic news agency irna quoted him as saying president hassan rouhani said on tuesday iran would remain committed to the deal without washington despite trumps decision to withdraw from it the pact was designed to deny tehran the ability to build nuclear weapons if we achieve the deals goals in cooperation with other members of the deal it will remain in place by exiting the deal america has officially undermined its commitment to an international treaty rouhani said in a televised speech i have ordered the foreign ministry to negotiate with the european countries china and russia in coming weeks if at the end of this short period we conclude that we can fully benefit from the jcpoa with the cooperation of all countries the deal would remain he said french foreign minister jeanyves le drian said the deal with iran was not dead and added that president emmanuel macron would speak later in the day to rouhani le drian said macrons contact with rouhani would be followed by meetings next week probably on monday involving the iranians and european counterparts from france britain and germany trumps decision drew fierce criticism from iranian officials and could give hardliners long opposed to the deal a greater edge over rouhani the biggest damage of the iran deal was legitimizing and sitting at the negotiating table with america irans army chief seyed abdul rahim moussavi said according to the iranian students news agency isna moussavi said americas withdrawal from the iran deal should also be a lesson to saudi arabia which was drawing closer to the united states isna reported shiite muslim iran has been locked in a regional power struggle with sunni muslim saudi arabia that has spilled into the wars in syria and yemen where they have backed opposing sides and fueled political rivalries in iraq and lebanon the united states gulf arab allies who see iran as a major security threat expressed strong support for trump under the deal struck between iran the united states russia china britain and france and germany tehran curbed its nuclear program in return for them lifting sanctions trumps decision sets the stage for a resurgence of political infighting within irans complex power structure iranian officials told reuters it could tip the balance of power in favor of hardliners looking to constrain rouhanis ability to open up to the west they will blame rouhani they will continue their shenanigans at home and abroad and they will have the us to blame for the failure of the economy said abbas milani director of the iranian studies program at stanford university rouhani tried to assure ordinary iranians frustrated by high unemployment and stagnant living standards that trumps decision would have no impact on irans oilreliant economy our heroic people will not be affected by this psychological attackirans economic progress will continue our people should not be worried at all he said irans ruling elite fears a revival of antigovernment protests in january that revealed the establishment was vulnerable to popular anger fueled by economic hardship at least 21 people were killed in the protests trump said he would reimpose economic sanctions on tehran immediately his decision puts pressure on his european allies which are reluctant to join the united states in reimposing sanctions on iran the us treasury said the united states would reimpose a wide array of iranrelated sanctions after the expiry of 90 and 180day winddown periods including sanctions aimed at irans oil sector and transactions with its central bank irans supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei whose hostility toward washington is the glue that holds together irans factionridden leadership had said iran would shred the deal if the united states pulled out rouhani said iran was ready

social the use of highstakes achievement tests around the world have created controversy among teachers parents students administrators policy makers and heads of state but whether or not youre a supporter of highstakes testing the fact remains that for now these assessments exist so perhaps the more important inquiry to pursue is how do teachers balance preparation for high stakes assessments with teaching and learning in their classrooms thats the question we put to our top 12 global teachers team this month here are their answers joe bower joebower from canada points to a potential future mode of assessment he has already swapped tests and grades in his classroom and replaced them with projects and performances collected in student portfolios he still teaches for tests as much as he needs to but doesnt let this overwhelm overall learning more from joe here craig kemp mrkempnz based in singapore which has a worldrenowned education system ranking 2nd on the pisa 2012 reading math and science tests says about testing that he has seen the negative result of this pressure on students every day he talks about how the emphasis in his classroom is on learning through real world experience rather than on cramming for high stakes tests in the end this helps students to excel across the board since it encourages them to love learning more from craig here angela watson angelawatson recommended by vicki davis coolcatteacher warns us that no matter how others may choose to evaluate your work you cant define your own success as a teacher according to whether students pass a standardized test thats a recipe for frustration and burnout angela recommends focusing on the tried and true goals of working to make a difference and igniting passion more from angela here karyn mcwhirter recommended by pauline hawkins paulinedhawkins notes that if an assessment is not a quality thinkingcommunicating task then giving it to students is a waste of time she has found that preparing students for ap tests is helping them to learn analysis argumentation and communication the problem for her is not with testing at large but the types of exams and what they are testing for more from karyn here todd finley finleyt believes highstakes standardized tests hssts undermine effective practice especially when we treat testing as content rather than just one of many ways of understanding what learners need todd shares his test prep tips but recommends that teachers trust their teacherresearcher brains by experimenting with different testprep activities analyzing the results and making creative adjustments more from todd here luke reynolds recommended by adam steiner steineredtech thinks students are more than just test scores and hence focuses less on the test and more on overall classwork hes not sure if this is too idealistic given the importance placed on testing elsewhere in the culture but in the end he expects that his students test scores wont suffer more from luke here richard wells ipadwells based in new zealand notes that the test prep playing field is out of whack in favor of the middle class this has to change however it involves not just teachers and schools but also the government making changes so we can move towards an environment of teamwork rather than competition more from richard here chris bacon recommended by adam steiner steineredtech doesnt have a magical answer however he comments that rather than teaching to the test the most successful schools teach through the test chris thinks that there are definitely ways to balance test prep with overall classroom needs the key he says is to emphasize critical thinking even when doing test prep more from chris here kelly meehan recommended by adam steiner steineredtech notes that as early as preschool high stakes testing has inundated the curriculum in schools she thinks we should be asking ourselves these questions what is the quality of the teaching and learning happening inside our classrooms is it the type of teaching and learning that is exploratory engaging and thought provoking a type of learning that rewards risk and wrong answers more from kelly here

economy more than 900 workers at a single meatpacking plant in south dakota were infected with the coronavirus over the course of just five weeks showing how quickly it can rip through an essential workforce toiling away in close quarters those numbers come from a report released thursday examining the smithfield pork facility in sioux falls which was home to one of the worst covid19 clusters in the country this spring the centers for disease control and prevention and state officials studied the outbreak to learn how it got so out of control the cdc report shows the outbreak was somewhat worse than previously believed state officials had earlier put the total number of infections at 853 according to the argus leader the actual number was 929 which translates into one of every four workers at the 3635person plant at the peak of the outbreak the workforce was averaging 67 new cases a day two workers eventually died in addition to the cases among employees at least 210 contacts of workers contracted the virus in total 39 workers and nine contacts ended up hospitalized the cdc did not openly criticize smithfield for its handling of the crisis and did not name the company in its report but the findings suggest the pork producer was slow to deal with the situation and didnt put many controls in place until it was too late the researchers concluded that what happened at the sioux falls plant shows how the coronavirus can spread rapidly in meat processing facilities because of the close proximity of workstations and prolonged contact between employees employers need to have a robust mitigation program consistent with published guidelines in order to mitigate the spread of the virus keira lombardo a smithfield executive vice president said in a statement that the companys coronavirus response has focused exclusively on keeping employees safe and maintaining the food supply she said the company took aggressive action that preceded the guidance on meatpacking safety released by the federal government in late april lombardo also said so many cases were detected at the plant because of a significantly disproportionate testing rate the cdc report acknowledged that workers at the sioux falls facility were tested at a higher rate than the community at large smithfield did not begin screening employees for fever and installing barriers inside the plant until april 3 by april 4 there were more than 240 cases at the plant nationally the coronavirus has hit the largely immigrant workforces inside meat and poultry plants particularly hard so far at least 65 workers have died and more than 14000 have been infected or exposed to the virus according to estimates from the united food and commercial workers union which represents workers at many plants workers at meatpacking plants across the country have reported laboring practically shoulder to shoulder even during the pandemic the cdc found that the attack rate the proportion of people in a given population infected with the virus was highest in departments where people could not work at least six feet apart not surprisingly hourly workers were nearly twice as likely to be infected as salaried workers inside the smithfield plant the latter researchers wrote typically had workstations that could be adjusted to maintain distancing and did not work in close proximity to other employees on the production line showing just how rapidly the outbreak escalated researchers found that the attack rate throughout the facility increased fivefold each week during the first three weeks after smithfield temporarily shuttered the plant the rate of new infections dropped significantly among workers to roughly 10 per day within a week the studys authors said that the virus likely spread in nonwork areas of the plant as well like locker and break rooms and that workers may also have transmitted it to one another while carpooling or living together they cautioned that whether a given worker contracted the virus inside the plant or out in the community could not be known the rapid city journal reported that the smithfield plant accounted for about 41 of coronavirus cases within the community during that time the first known worker to get sick developed symptoms on march 16 by march 28 around two dozen other workers showed signs of the coronavirus smithfield did not begin screening employees for fever and installing barriers inside the plant until april 3 by april 4 there were more than 240 cases in 23 different departments at the plant the cdc changed its guidance to recommend people wear a mask in public on april 3 which is the same day smithfield first made them optional at the plant according to the report but the company did not make masks mandatory until april 13 weeks after the outbreak first emerged by then the facility was already beginning a phased closure that would stop production for several weeks it was not until april 26 that the occupational safety and health administration in conjunction with the cdc released guidance for meatpacking plants on how to contain the virus they suggested protocols like installing barriers staggering break

technology dont be surprised if you start seeing more and more fees on your wireless bill thats one of the takeaways from a new report of the us mobile market according to tero kuittinen a mobile analyst and vice president at alekstra a firm that works to reduce companies phone bills only 11 million new wireless accounts were created the first three months of 2013 according to the report from chetan sharma consulting a firm that specializes in mobile trends and strategy this represents a whopping 60 percent decline over the number of new connections in the same quarter of 2012 thats a huge problem for the wireless industry which thrived in previous years as new customers signed up for mobile subscriptions as an example kuittenen points to a 061 mobility administrative fee that att started charging last month that may not sound like much but that means an additional 775 million annually for att and that fee is only the latest in a series of moves the biggest us wireless carriers have made to extract more revenue from their customers earlier this month att said it would no longer offer early device upgrade discounts to its contract holders and extended its upgrade period to 24 months verizon made a similar policy change in april so that means if you find yourself in need of a phone and its been fewer than two years youll have to pay a penalty because youre not yet eligible for an upgrade and speaking of upgrades last year both verizon and att increased their upgrade fees so the question remains is there any hope of curbing expensive and increasing smartphone bills chetan sharma who leads the consulting firm said that if tmobile and sprint the two carriers that have for years lagged behind att and verizon were to merge then customers would have more options if you just have two players who are dominant and the other two are struggling then consumers might not get the choices that three players bring to the market sharma told huffpost its important for a third strong player but for now att and verizon control a massive 65 percent of the us wireless market its a duopoly kuittinen said its clear when it comes to consumer prices competition isnt working we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again click here to read kuittinens full post on bgr and here for chetan sharma consultings presentation

technology san francisco reuters tablets with paperthin screens that can be folded and tucked into your back pocket artificial intelligence and augmented reality the stuff of science fiction may be coming to a store near you its been two years since apple inc launched the ipad and spawned rival tablets from the likes of samsung electronics co amazoncom inc sony corp and now google inc and microsoft corp much of the competition so far has centered on making smartphone and tablets lighter slimmer faster and longerrunning than their predecessors and the trend shows no signs of slowing the increasingly crowded marketplace is also galvanizing hardware designers and software engineers to explore new technologies that may revolutionize the look and feel of mobile devices in coming years we should think beyond just the touchscreen device said lin zhong a professor at rice university who does research on mobile systems why do we have to hold tablets carry many displays we should think about wearable computers some researchers are experimenting with wearable devices such as google glass a stampsized electronic screen mounted on eyeglass frames to record video access email and surf the web others like microsoft are investigating the use of 3d cameras to create images that pop up when a person calls samsung has a concept video that shows a bendable transparent 3d smartphonehybrid tablet that can also be used as a realtime interpreter few of these new technologies will hit store shelves any time soon companies and researchers are more actively working on touchscreen innovations in the near term in particular organiclightemitting diodes or oled is widely touted as the successor to liquid crystal displays oled displays such as in samsungs galaxy note smartphone are lighter thinner and tougher than current displays the main attraction of oled at first are their ruggedness but the technology could one day allow tablets to be folded or rolled up like a newspaper reaching that point poses challenges like making the delicate chips and components inside them more flexible and resistant to damage flexible and foldable displays will first be implemented on smaller sizes like smartphones said rhoda alexander ihs isupplis tablet analyst tablets may follow in a later progression once manufacturing costs and yields have been tested an unfolding newsslate concept developed by innovationbermer labs shows a foldable tablet that one can use to read news and watch videos these are not expected to be ready for prime time for another few years apart from experimenting with various materials in their own labs manufacturers are partnering with premier academic institutions in their quest for the most interactive screens samsung is working with stanford universitys chemical engineering department and microsoft is working with rice university professor zhenan baos team at stanford has developed stretchable supersensitive and solarpowered electronic skin or sensors that can feel a touch as light as that of a fly one of its obvious applications is in touchscreens and bao said the research has generated a lot of inquiries from companies right now there is a lot of interest in having sensors in the screen that can have pressure input for the touchscreen bao said companies are also basically looking for replacement material for the current silicon that is cheaper and compatible with plastic substrate but has the same performance level specialty glass company corning inc famous for its gorilla glass used in apple devices has an ultraslim flexible glass called willow glass that has the potential to enable displays to be wrapped around a device corning said it is currently shipping samples of willow glass which is compatible with oled displays to companies each new generation of tablets boasts big improvements in pixel density and image quality making photos games and movies more lifelike manufacturers and software designers have made less progress finding ways to let computers give physical tactile feedback but theyre working on it the stakes are high as tablets become more and more integrated with smartphones and other devices at home betting on the right technology and features is imperative since the stillnew category has already claimed many victims including hewlett packards touchpad tablet that was killed last year after only a few months on the market with many companies entering the fray vying to take share away from apples ipad those who get it right may end up influencing the way people communicate and consume all media for now size and price is where most manufacturers are competing as they try to break the dominance of apple in the tablet market six out of 10 tablets sold are ipads the big open area that is left to tackle is truly great input said tony fadell cofounder and chief executive officer of nest thermostat who previously led the team at apple that created 18 generations of ipods and three generations of the iphone there is tactile input as well as voice input those are the two inputs that still need to be addressed in tablets fadell said in a recent patent application related to tactile or haptic technology apple in may outlined how features could be added to a screen that would make it possible to alter the feel of its surface manufacturers are also working to improve gesture recognition augmented reality and voice controls like apples siri ibm fellow bernie meyerson expects major breakthroughs in artificial intelligence in the next several years he envisions people having real spoken conversations with their devices which will boast technology much more advanced than ibms watson computer that defeated two champions on the jeopardy gameshow last year you hand it to your grandmother and it just works it will adapt tune itself to your voice meyerson said youll have something that you carry around in your pocket and it listens to you when you want it to

social being fresh in the public education sector i naturally began comparing my onthefield observations with my own 12 years of experience as a publicschooled standardizedtested student whats on my mind today how students learn the english language while my rather extreme personal experiences might be more indicative of the education system in singapore but i see clear parallels here in chicago i loved english or more accurately i loved english as a tested subject because i was great at it the year was 1998 fresh off the proverbial boat in singapore i was blessed to be able to pick up the english language quite naturally yup english is one of singapores official languages before i knew it i was getting nothing less than an a and bagging the top prize for english each year thus began by tempestuous love affair with the language i graduated from a nowdefunct primary elementary school and moved on to a reasonably reputable secondary school grades 710 this school was reputable because it consistently produced high scorers in the o levels the national examination that served to rank all 10thgraders in the country to determine which junior colleges grades 1112 are within their reach as you can imagine what made a secondary school elite then was its ability to prepare students to outsmart this system the concept of good words was again and again drilled in us what made a word good this nebulous concept was never explicitly defined but what i understood was that these were the big andor unusual words that would earn us little check marks in our essays and the more check marks there are on our manuscripts the more impressed the grader will be and the more likely they are to bestow a high grade writing became to me an exercise in showing off my vocabulary preparing for the english essay exam meant poring over the thesaurus dont write beautiful butterflies if you can say beauteous butterflies or blue skies when theres the superior azure blue no one told me that and i dont think anyone meant to i internalized it myself dont get me wrong i have nothing against big words as we get older we experience more and feel more and wed need words with more nuance and precision to articulate thoughts with greater accuracy but at the middle school age did i really need to be saying i was surrounded by gargantuan trees and the math problem obfuscated me and what good comes out of my mother harangued me with a barrage of errands i wrote like that blogged like that and was proud of it my peers would validate my false confidence in the english language by telling me how good my english was once a classmate introduced me to his father this way pa this is karen her english is very good in 10th grade i was once illprepared for a big endofyear essaywriting exam so i had no choice but to write a simple and plain essay about why homemade gifts will always be superior to storebought gifts my grader thought it was lovely and made copies for the entire class i was honesttogod mortified i didnt want that essay to be read by everyone there werent enough good words in there not an accurate representation of my language ability i was forced to conclude that this particular grader had unusually and patronizingly low standards for writing a few years later i left singapore to go to college at the university of chicago at some point i found myself in a creative writing class with a bunch of snobbishwellintentioned i cant decide english majors one of the critiques was particularly brutal its clear that youve read a lot she wrote but its also clear that english is not your first language ouch for so many years i was confident that apart from my accent i exhibited no other telltale sign of english being a second language thus began the deconstruction of everything i thought i knew about having a good grasp of a language what i learned a little late but better late than never a language is a tool of communication not a subject matter in and of itself unless were talking about linguistics its not about the quality of the words you use as if there were even any objective measure of the relative superiority of words but the quality of your message it is our thoughts and our ideas that are valuable not the words we use the words we use therefore should convey our message not obscure it i currently teach math but i dont have a single student who likes their english class and it makes me wonder why i loved it because i happened to be an obnoxious little linguaphile the way english classes are often run would surely turn off any kid who isnt one if i were to venture into teaching english in the future id be sure to tell my students every day that the true value of writing lies in their ideas and their ideas are so valuable that the words they pick to communicate them have no business stealing the spotlight and maybe just maybe if they also come to see how valuable their ideas and opinions are theyd be willing to put in the effort to pick up the vocabulary and grammar skills that would help them better convey them we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you

science all your fears stresses and anxieties have one thing in common they are sensed by a pair of peasized patches of neurons called the amygdala sitting deep inside your brain so what if you could control your amygdala what if you could change your brain and become calmer and braver that idea has a particular appeal for people suffering from depression anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder but its easier said than done the amygdala is an old part of the brain that does its job automatically without much care for commands from more conscious parts of the mind you cant just tell an oversensitive amygdala to quiet down but a brain training technique known as neurofeedback might help people find a way to change such involuntary and automatic brain processes in recent years the technique is being developed and refined to address mental health issues the treatment involves monitoring a persons brain activity in real time using electroencephalography eeg or functional mri brain scans and showing those patterns of activity to the person so they can try to boost or reduce them basically changing how their brain functions in a new study published last month in biological psychiatry researchers set up a series of experiments to use neurofeedback to teach several dozen people how to regulate their amygdala activity people were able to use this new eeg model to learn how to control their brain activity in a deeply located brain area the amygdala said dr talma hendler a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the tel aviv center for brain functions in israel this method opens a wide horizon of treatment possibilities for the mentally ill but also for everyone on a daily basis as an empowering tool for mental activity and well being reading brain signals from deep parts of the brain is difficult especially with a cheap and accessible method functional mri or fmri can access these areas but the device is a complex gigantic magnet that you cant just set up at home even if you could afford it eeg on the other hand is cheaper and simpler it mainly involves a few electrodes placed on the scalp the downside of eeg is that it cant accurately zoom in on structures deep in the brain so the researchers combined the two methods they used the detail provided by fmri to tease out the amygdalas signal from the electrical activity picked up by the eeg this method enables homebased imaging that targets brain regions relevant for our mental health hendler said it opens a wide horizon of treatment possibilities for the mentally ill but also for everyone on a daily basis as an empowering tool for mental activity and well being for the experiments hendler and her colleagues asked the volunteers to listen to a sound they were then instructed to lower the volume of the sound by exercising mental strategies it sounds like a vague instruction what are the mental strategies that can seemingly telepathically control the volume of a sound no one really knows and thats sort of the point people have to try many different ways of thinking thereby changing their brain activity until they stumble upon a desired activity pattern what the participants didnt know was that the volume of the sound was programmed to change based on the electrical activity of their own amygdala and it would lower if the participants managed to dial down that activity in other words they were listening to their own amygdalas firing disguised in a sound a series of tests afterward showed that this game seemed to help participants become more capable of regulating the activity of their amygdala in response to viewing a series of images for example the participants amygdalas seemed less sensitive compared to those of people in another group given a fake neurofeedback treatment the participants in this study were healthy but hendler believes that people with mental health problems too would respond to training with neurofeedback we already have indication for this unpublished yet that people suffering from depression chronic pain and post traumatic disorders are able to learn and greatly benefit from such training hendler said if the method proves useful in treating mental health conditions in the future this lowcost personalized treatment could be used at home to complement and sometimes substitute medications hendler said
economy three hundred flight attendants at american airlines subsidiary piedmont airlines have voted to authorize a strike by an overwhelming margin according to their union the association of flight attendantscwa afa said thursday that 100 of workers who cast ballots approved of striking if piedmont airlines doesnt offer them a satisfactory contract the workers have been trying to secure a new collective bargaining agreement with the regional carrier for three years with negotiations interrupted by the pandemic flight attendants are pretty fed up with whats been going on keturah johnson a flight attendant and president of the unions local affiliate for piedmont workers told huffpost right now they cant afford to work for piedmont the company doesnt care for us and theyre stalling negotiations a spokesperson for marylandbased piedmont airlines said the company which is part of american airlines american eagle group of regional carriers planned to return to the bargaining table with the union in november we have the most professional flight service professionals in the industry and piedmont is a leader in safety and performance because of their efforts crystal byrd the spokesperson said in an email we are in agreement our team members deserve the best contract and we are committed to delivering that to them a strike authorization doesnt necessarily mean workers will end up walking off the job its an escalation tactic that gives the unions leadership the leeway to call a strike if they see fit ten thousand workers at agricultural equipment manufacturer john deere went on strike last week after rejecting a deal their union negotiated roughly 60000 film and television workers have also threatened to go on strike though a work stoppage has been averted for now after their union reached a tentative agreement over the weekend airline workers must go through a special process before initiating a work stoppage since a strike could have ripple effects for passengers across the country federal regulators will review the case and decide whether the two parties have reached an impasse and should be released from mediation if so they can allow the union to carry out a legal strike after a 30day cooling off period in the vast majority of airlinerelated cases the union and the employer avoid a work stoppage but if a strike comes to pass it could be a major nuisance for piedmont and its parent company american the afa deploys its own strike strategy known as chaos which stands for create havoc around our system rather than all flight attendants walking off at once the union carries out intermittent surprise strikes by small crews of workers that lead to flight cancellations the strategy bedevils the targeted employer without causing widespread disruption across airlines and airports afa first used chaos against alaska airlines in 1993 when it rattled the carrier by striking just seven seemingly random flights over the course of nine months eventually securing a new contract workers in certain industries are enjoying a moment of leverage due to a tighterthanexpected labor market amid the pandemic some employers say theyve had a hard time finding workers to meet demand giving their workforces an auspicious time to withhold their labor to secure good raises or other gains that certainly appears to be the case in the airline industry where staffing shortages have contributed to delays one common theme in recent strikes including those at deere and food makers kelloggs and nabisco is employers use of twotier compensation systems in which workers are divided into separate classes and offered different pay rates and benefits some workers have rebelled against these systems saying there should be equal pay for equal work johnson said there is a twotier system at work in the piedmont dispute the different pay for workers at mainline carriers like american versus their regional carriers like piedmont which fly between big hubs and smaller airports the afa says flight attendants at regional carriers earn 45 less in pay and benefits on average even though they wear the uniforms of the major carriers we remain

end up earning less than they could working fulltime at retailers like target she said a lot of workers cant afford to get hotel rooms or shared apartments when they commute from other cities to the

economy geek squad employees have been working as fbi informants for more than a decade newly released documents show revealing a much closer relationship between the two organizations than formerly reported while wed previously known some of the best buy workers alerted law enforcement whenever they found illegal material like child pornography on customers hard drives the new documents show that the fbi met with the geek squad team at least as early as 2008 and apparently viewed some workers as paid informants the electronic frontier foundation filed a freedom of information act request for the documents last year and released them on tuesday the bureau refused to confirm or deny if it has similar relationships with other electronics repair companies the documents indicate geek squad technicians only flagged federal agents when they found child pornography on a clients computer so its hard to be too upset nevertheless it raises concerning questions about potential violations of the fourth amendments protection against unreasonable searches and seizures seeking to calm fears a best buy spokesperson told huffpost in an emailed statement that their technicians do not actively search for such content and only discover it inadvertently but in at least one instance that doesnt seem to be the case per the eff an illicit image found on the hard drive of mark rettenmaier a california doctor who dropped off his computer at a best buy in 2011 was stored on unallocated space on the disk that typically requires forensic software to find rettenmaier was tried in 2017 on felony child pornography charges but the case was thrown out after us district judge cormac carney ruled the fbi warrant that allowed the search of rettenmaiers home a warrant granted based on the image found by geek squad was obtained via false and misleading statements eff documents show this wasnt a oneoff case and that the fbi handled numerous incidents in similar fashion after being alerted by geek squad technicians at the companys repair facility in kentucky the companys kentucky geek squad city facility handles more serious repairs including work like data recovery that could require them to sift through a customers data records uncovered as a result of the rettenmaier case show the bureau had eight fbi informants at geek squad city from 20072012 and that some geek squad employees were paid between 500 and 1000 for their help at least one geek squad technician attempted to give the money back and was rebuffed in an emailed statement to huffpost best buy sought to temper concerns about possibly illegal searches saying the company has both a moral and in some cases legal obligation to alert authorities when employees find child pornography as it does nearly 100 times a year customers are also made aware of the policy in writing prior to geek squad beginning any repair as a company we have not sought or received training from law enforcement in how to search for child pornography the company said our policies prohibit employees from doing anything other than what is necessary to solve the customers problem in the wake of these allegations we have redoubled our efforts to train employees on what to do and not do in these circumstances we have learned that four employees may have received payment after turning over alleged child pornography to the fbi the company continued any decision to accept payment was in very poor judgement and inconsistent with our training and policies three of these employees are no longer with the company and the fourth has been reprimanded and reassigned

environment some press accounts and various advocates have labeled the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi as near the brink of failure because of the recent trend of very low auction prices likewise commentators have recently characterized the european union emission trading scheme eu ets as possibly sinking into oblivion because of low allowance prices since when are low prices which in this case reflect low marginal abatement costs considered to be a problem to understand whats going on we need to remind ourselves of the purpose and promise of a capandtrade regime and then look at whats been happening in the respective markets the purpose and promise of capandtrade a capandtrade system if welldesigned implemented and enforced will limit total emissions of the regulated pollutant to the desired level the cap and will do this if the cap is binding in a costeffective manner by leading regulated sources to each make reductions until they are all experiencing the same marginal abatement cost the allowance price thus the sources that initially face the highest abatement costs reduce less and those sources that face the lowest abatement costs reduce more achieving systemwide minimum costs that is cost effectiveness so the purpose and promise in a nutshell is to achieve the targeted level of aggregate pollution control and if the cap is binding do this at the lowest possible cost the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi a downstream capandtrade system for co emissions from the power sector in 10 northeast states connecticut maine maryland massachusetts new hampshire new jersey new york rhode island and vermont with new jersey now in the process of withdrawing from the coalition was launched with relatively unambitious targets principally in order to keep prices down to prevent severe leakage of electricity demand and hence leakage of co emissions from the rggi region to states and provinces outside of the region mainly from new york to pennsylvania emissions are capped from 2012 to 2014 and then starting in 2015 the cap decreases 25 percent per year until it is down by 10 percent in 2019 this would represent a level of emissions 13 percent below the 1990 level of emissions it was originally thought that this would be some 35 percent below the businessasusual bau level in 2019 sounds good what happened is not that the system performed other than designed but that business was not as usual that is what happened is that unregulated powersector bau emissions in the northeast fell significantly see the graph below of the rggi cap and historical emissions so why did emissions fall in the rggi states this happened for three reasons first because of increasing supplies in the united states of lowcost unconventional sources of natural gas prices for this fuel have fallen dramatically since 2008 see the graph below of natural gas and coal prices that has meant greater dispatch of electricity from gasfueled power plants relative to coalfired plants more investment in new gasfired generating plants less investment in coalfired generating capacity and retirement of existing coalfired capacity all of which has contributed to lower co emissions second the worst economic recession since the great depression hit the united states in 2008 causing dramatic reductions in electricity demand in the industrial and commercial sectors reducing emissions see the graph below of quarterly percentage change in us gdp 20072009 third and finally moderate northeast temperatures have kept down co emissions linked with both heating and cooling low emissions low allowance demand low allowance prices so for the three reasons above bau co emissions from the power sector in the rggi states are dramatically below what was originally and quite reasonably anticipated the supply of rggi co allowances made available at auction is by law unchanged but demand for these allowances has fallen dramatically hence the fall in rggi allowance prices see the graph below of rggi allowance prices 20082010 given that emissions are below the rggi cap and due to expectations regarding future natural gas prices are likely to remain below the cap there is no scarcity of allowances shouldnt the price fall to zero in theory yes except that the system has an auction reservation price of 186 per ton built in thereby creating a price floor of precisely this amount so the cap put in place by the rggi system is being achieved but it is not binding rggi may not be particularly relevant but it is not thereby a flawed system surely it is not a failure rather a great environmental success has been achieved by the fortunate coincidence of low natural gas prices economic recession and mild weather this is hardly something to be lamented true enough the rggi system does have flaws such as its narrow scope limited to electricity generation and its lack of a simple safety valve as i have written about in the past but the low allowance prices are evidence of a success outside of the rggi market not evidence of failure within the rggi market if the rggi states have the desire and the political will to tighten the cap in the future then the system can again become binding environmentally relevant and costeffective thats an ongoing political debate to be fair i should note that the same outcome i have described here can be spun perhaps for political purposes quite differently recently a selfdescribed freemarket energy blog commentator claimed not without some justification that rggi is irrelevant or worse bottom line the program has raised electricity prices created a slush fund for each of the member states and has had virtually no impact on emissions or on global climate change phrased differently due to exogenous circumstances ive described above the rggi program is nonbinding and so has no direct effect on emissions but its relatively low auction reservation price does lead to very small impacts on electricity prices and produces revenues for participating states revenues which those states would surely claim are of value for statelevel energyefficiency and other programs that indirectly do affect co emissions so the real bottom line is that low rggi allowance prices are not a consequence of poor system design or a fatal flaw of capandtrade systems in general but rather a consequence of what are in reality some exogenous coincidences that have turned out to be good news for the environment now lets turn to the european union emissions trading scheme eu ets unlike rggi the eu ets has not been irrelevant it has successfully capped european co emissions achieved significant emissions reductions and it has done so more or less costeffectively more about this hedging on costeffectiveness below not surprisingly like rggi the eu ets has some design flaws principally its limited scope electricity generation and largescale manufacturing and lack of a safetyvalve but as with rggi its low allowance prices should not be taken as bad news but to some degree as good news and certainly not as a sign of failure of the eu ets handwringing in europe over low allowance prices there has been much handwringing in europe over the failure of the system because of low allowance prices indeed danish energy minister martin lidegaard said earlier this month that low carbon prices threaten the eu ets of course hes correct that eu ets allowance prices are low they are down from their historic average of about 20 per ton of co to about 9 per ton currently having reached an alltime low of 788 in early april heres a graph of eu ets allowance prices euas over the crucial period of change january 2007 to january 2009 at this point in this essay i probably dont need to say that this pattern is partly explained by the global recession which has hit europe particularly hard and now threatens a doubledip recession in a number of european nations lower european and global demand has meant decreased economic activity in europe hence lower energy demand lower co emissions and therefore lower demand and lower prices for eu ets allowances even if we assume a growth rate of european co emissions 1 percent less than the growth rate of gdp represented by the dotted counterfactual bau line in the graph below which estimates what emissions would have been from 2005 to 2010 without the introduction of the eus emissions trading system the evidence makes clear that the eu ets has succeeded in reducing emissions significantly below what would be expected from the recession alone this is where an important caveat needs to be introduced also feeding into this allowance price depression has been a set of national and regional energy policies such as those promoting use of renewables which have served to reduce emissions demand for allowances and hence allowance prices while rendering the overall co program less costeffective by ensuring that marginal abatement costs remain heterogeneous so to the degree that the low allowance prices are due to socalled complimentary policies the low prices are bad news about public policy in costeffectiveness terms not good news but this refers to misguided complimentary policies which fail to bring about any incremental emissions reductions under the capandtrade umbrella and drive up aggregate cost not to any design flaw in the eu ets itself multiple goals typically require multiple policy instruments no doubt minister lidegaard is aware of the allowance price impacts of the recession and i hope hes aware of the allowance price consequences of these other energy and environmental policies the problem arises however because he sees the fundamental purpose of the eu ets as somewhat broader than what i described at the beginning of this essay namely achieving emissions consistent with some cap and doing so costeffectively if the cap is binding for him and many other european observers the purpose of the ets was to cap co emissions in the eu and ensure clear economic incentives for investment in renewables so the handwringing is not about a failure to achieve emissions reductions costeffectively but to have prices high enough to achieve other goals in this case greater use of renewable sources of energy for others the other goals have involved allowance prices high enough to bring about some

readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again as i have written at this blog in the past having multiple policy goals typically necessitates multiple policy instruments for example if the goal is a combination of reducing emissions costeffectively and having prices maintained at some minimum whether to bring about greater use of renewable energy sources or to inspire more technology innovation then two policy instruments are needed to do the job a capandtrade system for the first goal in combination with a carbon tax in the form of a price floor as in rggi for the second goal dont throw out the baby with the bath water in other words the eu ets has not failed but the design was inadequate that is incomplete for what politicians now seem to want if the europeans want a price floor in their system or better yet a price collar which would combine a price floor with a safety valve ie price ceiling then this is certainly feasible technically and economically likewise if the eu member states have the desire and the political will to tighten the cap in the future there are a variety of ways in which they can accomplish this rendering the program more stringent and increasing allowances prices but in any event the european commissions energy division environment division and climate division should sort out the real effects of the complimentary policies that have contaminated the eu ets and which fail to bring about additional emissions reductions but drive up costs whether any of this is feasible politically is a question that my european colleagues and friends can best address
economy the securities and exchange commission has waded into the debate over what investors can do to stop fossil fuel companies from destroying the earths habitable climate and in siding with a major oil company the agency inadvertently strengthened the case for divesting from fossil fuels altogether late last year trillium asset management an investment firm that works with environmental groups but also has fossil fuel investments proposed a shareholder resolution calling for eog resources one of the largest oil producers in the country to set a target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions but before shareholders could vote on the proposal eog complained to the sec requesting approval to ignore the proposal which it said would micromanage the company with a rigid and timebound target in february the sec agreed with eogs concerns stating shareholders would not be in a position to make an informed judgment on the matters of a complex nature on which the resolutions sought to act last month the sec sent a formal letter to trillium rejecting the proposal allowing eog to ignore the resolution and block a vote axios amy harder who drew national attention to the case earlier this month called the move unprecedented leaving investors stunned the ruling is a major setback for advocates who say internal shareholder pressure from highminded investors is the best way to reduce pollution by corporate giants it also adds new weight to arguments calling for more severe government intervention in the energy industry either by nationalizing utilities and fossil fuel producers or imposing steep levies on emissions and extractive industries but with republicans in control of all three branches of the federal government and democrats largely wrestling over whether to embrace more leftist economic principles neither of these prospects is likely to happen in the near future so at least in the short term the sec decision strengthens the case that the only serious strategy for investors to pressure fossil fuel companies is to completely pull their money out in the year leading up to last february shareholders filed 429 resolutions 83 focused on climate change according to an annual report tracking such proposals of that 83 figure which represents 20 percent of all proposals 27 resolutions called for carbon risk disclosures and another 27 demanded that companies set deadlines for reducing emissions such proposals even when enacted do little to incentivize companies to change polluting business practices while providing a veneer of progressive action take for example exxon mobil corp the oil giant caved to shareholder pressure last year to thoroughly account for its climate change risks and in february issued its first report but in a brazen move the report claimed there is nearly no risk to exxon mobils business in march occidental petroleum one of the largest oil producers in texas responded to shareholders climate concerns with its own report finding curiously that the companys business wont be impacted by global warming or policies to reduce the emissions causing it the existence of the reports represents the start of slow change at these companies said danielle fugere president of the nonprofit as you sow which tracks shareholder proxy fights even if the reports are tailored to bolster companies profit outlook she said they provide information to investors that can ultimately strengthen the case for divestment even when a company doesnt necessarily give you the response you want their response gives you information and thats the real goal she told huffpost obviously the oil and gas companies havent changed what they do but from an investor perspective even getting them to think about how they can transition is good but that sort of patient approach to shifting away from fossil fuels conflicts with the increasingly dire warnings from climate scientists who say the world economy requires an urgent transformation to avoid planetary catastrophe small incremental fixes in the form of market solutions and corporate reformism represent what the intercepts kate aronoff described as denial by a different name shareholder resolutions and shareholder activism pushing fossil fuel companies to change has to take into account what we are really asking for we need to see real decarbonization plans ben cushing who helps lead the sierra clubs beyond dirty fuels campaign told huffpost that really gets at the core of the fossil fuel industrys business model the divestment movement gained significant momentum this year after new york city announced plans in january to pull roughly 5 billion in pension fund investments out of oil gas and coal companies and sue oil companies for climate changerelated damages a move quickly followed by other cities european capitals including berlin stockholm and paris made similar divestments in 2016 the dominant framework has been about a neoliberal approach and it has failed over and over again since companies werent being responsive to shareholders anyway witness exxons recent absurd declaration that it faced no real climate risk it may save everyone the trouble of pretending that theyll someday actually engage bill mckibben the founder of 350org told huffpost it further strengthens the already overwhelming argument for divestment and makes politicians like bill de blasio and scott stringer look prescient for the announcement earlier this year that new york city was done playing around with these guys still even divestment is only a first step the dominant framework has been about a neoliberal approach and it has failed over and over again ashley dawson author of the book extreme cities the peril and promise of urban life in the age of climate change told huffpost that whole approach is hugely flawed so i think we need to really think about a much more radical solution we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism

and shift the united kingdom to 65 percent renewable energy by 2030 we need to have really progressive conversations about how we get from where we are presently to carbon zero state he said to have a conversation about how to do that on a national scale and how to do that at a really fast rate we need to be talking about a public push rather than the kind of marketbased arguments you hear so much in the united states
worldnews keeping medical data electronically is ideal it saves time and can be used more efficiently when it comes to killer diseases in africa many people think of infectious diseases like tuberculosis malaria or even ebola but the reality is that diseases like cancer diabetes and heart disease known as noncommunicable diseases ncds are a major threat its estimated that there will be about 39 million deaths from these diseases in africa by 2020 the rising burden will have an impact not only on peoples health it will also affect economic productivity and the social fabric of societies this is why theres been an increasing focus on ncds theyre been included in the sustainable development goals and will be the focus of the upcoming world health assembly but african policymakers can only make headway if the performance of health systems are measured this is particularly true given the limited resources they have this would help them come up with more effective and efficient health interventions which in turn will enable them to plan better and work faster to save more lives the efficacy of health systems has traditionally been measured on the basis of access to services counting the number of people who visit facilities this information has also typically been geared towards care for shortlived conditions such as malaria or diarrhoea but ncds need a different approach the health landscape must evolve to take into account their rising prominence and the fact that their effects are longlasting and more expensive to treat picture for instance a 42yearold woman in a village in botswana who was diagnosed with diabetes a year ago she has been visiting a local clinic once a month for checkups yet her blood sugar remains high despite her regular visits no one has examined her feet to check for ulcers or infections that might put her at risk of amputation and she was not put on appropriate blood pressure medicine even though its available at the facility even though she has logged over 12 visits her disease is not being controlled her example illustrates that she and millions like are dont just need access to health services other components such as quality and efficiency matter too whats more is that theres no information about these gaps in the system no data on the quality of services reaches health care providers facility managers and policymakers if it did it might shed light on what can be done to improve healthcare for example training efforts could be extended to include foot examination techniques or how to ramp up medicine doses safely data could also help identify patients whose disease is controlled and can have their visits more spread out this would shorten waiting time in queues for sicker patients and free up time for health care providers to focus on other duties like patient group education and documentation yet health system information in general is lacking in developing countries including many in subsaharan africa even basic systems to record vital events such as births and deaths are incomplete more than a third of the worlds 128 million births a year and twothirds of its 57 million deaths are not registered the shortage of databases is acute for example there are only 25 cancer registries that track cancer cases these only cover 18 out of 52 countries this is one of the reasons why the world health organisation estimates that only one in five low and middleincome countries have the necessary data to guide cancer policy and planning measuring the performance of health systems in their entirety must be prioritised the burden of disease may be known but what is the health system doing about it people are able to get care but is the care making a difference if not what can be changed making this information available is no small task african health systems are already under strain long patient lines and busy clinics hinder detailed documentation interruptions in electricity and internet connectivity challenge reliable electronic record keeping people managing health information systems also have limited technical capacity but the process need not be so cumbersome first sets of core information that have the greatest potential to improve policies in hospitals and clinics must be identified an example is recording the stage of a cancer at diagnosis and completion of treatment health authorities would need to standardise and make routine reporting of these throughout the country this is what contributed to rwandas unprecedented health sector performance the country slashed under5 child mortality by over twothirds maternal mortality by more than half and hiv mortality by more than half between 2000 and 2015 it also played a part in treating tuberculosis in malawi and hiv in kenya and nigeria although these arent noncommunicable diseases lessons can be learnt data collection can be improved by engaging doctors and nurses at the front lines of care this has been done at the butaro cancer centre of excellence in rwanda where the electronic medical records system was designed to facilitate clinical management of patients at the same time it supported programme monitoring and evaluation and took into account existing limitations in skilled personnel and internet connectivity given the rural setting keeping data in its electronic form is ideal it will ultimately save time and can be designed to manage data across diseases such as hiv and events such as deaths this is not without its challenges in many african settings but there are silver linings even with unreliable electricity and internet connections many health information systems are already electronic and theres a groundswell of mobile technology innovations that can be put to use the time is now for africa to count the things that matter to improve health and save more lives neo tapela instructor harvard medical school this article was

science why do people have sex the way they do there are lots of puzzling things about that but three really stand out sex between two chimpanzees takes a few seconds but sex between humans can take hours why are we so different from them men can only have a few orgasms but women can have lots of orgasms separated by long intervals of high arousal why are we so different from each other and finally surveys done by people like shere hite and alfred kinsey have consistently shown that intercourse isnt really the easiest way for many women to have an orgasm 3 oral sex and masturbation often work better but why wouldnt the activity that leads to fertilization be the most reliably pleasurable one and why do we humans engage in so many other sexual activities from anal sex to zoophilia that also have nothing to do with reproduction to answer these questions wed need to know how our human way of having sex evolved but theres no generally accepted theory ten years ago elizabeth lloyds explanation of the female orgasm looked pretty plausible 5 she argued that women can have many orgasms simply because there never was any reason for a limit to evolve they have nothing to do with reproduction theyre just an evolutionary accident but our story about human evolution has changed since then now that the idea of cultural learning has become more central to that story does sex look any different i could be wrong about this but lloyds evolutionary accident theory doesnt really seem right to me anymore instead im starting to suspect that the multiple orgasm may have helped make us what we are today if people everywhere really understood why humans have sex the way they do if they really understood the competitive obstacle course nature has laid out for them i think they might be happier themselves and more useful to their partners to explain why things look so different to me now i have to tell you how our theories about human evolution are changing the easiest way for me to do that is by pointing out one last biologically surprising feature of human sex one that might not have seemed that important to us 10 or 15 years ago anybody who was ever a teenager can probably remember a few moments of sexual awkwardness hopefully things got better later on if they did thats an example of learning googling sexual techniques brings up trendy terms like karezza and coital alignment those are also things people have to work pretty hard to learn how to do people in different cultures learn to have sex in very different ways in some cultures a man without a pierced penis is considered inadequate in others the female orgasm is completely ignored the ancient egyptians masturbated in public but in one small irish community in the 1950s couples kept their clothes on so sex wouldnt become too enjoyable samesex interactions may be taboo or obligatory thats very weird in every other animal sexual behavior seems to be completely instinctive how can it be so wildly variable in humans and why would evolution ever want to put an extra hurdle learning between us and reproduction of course sex isnt the only thing humans have to learn how to do a chimpanzee is pretty smart but it doesnt learn that much about sex or anything else from other chimpanzees humans uniquely have to learn how to be human from other humans everything we learn from others how to make a fire how to keep a promise how to speak english how to kiss is culture its now becoming clear to us that cultural learning is the really distinctive thing about the human animal in the older social intelligence model the human mind evolved so we could outwit others in a competition for scarce resources but chimpanzees already compete for resources what they dont do is teach the hero of kim sterelnys new cultural learning story about human evolution isnt the successful schemer its the person who is good at teaching new skills and learning new skills from other people 6 if we humans have to learn to have sex too then that fact must fit into this new story somehow and it does fit perfectly the fact that we have to learn how to have sex and can get better at it over time actually looks like a pretty crucial missing piece human sex seems to select us for the ability to learn from our sex partners learning from others is what we humans specialize in so it makes perfect evolutionary sense to find this exact kind of obstacle course playing a role in our sexual behavior it would be more surprising if it wasnt there let me explain all that human lovers in having sex are learning to collaborate on a project thats something like jazz improvisation darwin argued in the descent of man that music was originally a form of sexual display theyre learning to participate in a particular kind of creative performance and contribute something unique to it that makes it better attention is being shared roles are assumed and reversed there are solos and duets theres a lot of direct eye contact as the two lovers simultaneously try to see themselves through each others eyes like narcissus peering into the reflecting pool when things are going well they share an almost telepathic connection most of our learning about sex is nonverbal so this learning situation is actually quite a lot like the one we encounter when were babies and toddlers and are first trying to learn how to interact with other people and talk if weve learned to play our role really well then many of the performances were involved in are going to be enjoyable ones the way we have sex mostly seems to convey information about our creativity and teachability humans are creatures who compete with each other in trying to master complex cultural skills like hunting elephants and playing the piano and public speaking if our kids inherit our ability to learn from others and use the learned skills creatively theyll have an advantage in that competition so if the sex was enjoyable it makes perfect biological sense for our partner to have sex with us again tomorrow weve just demonstrated in a way that cant be faked that were good at learning from other people a small difference in the probability that theyll stay depending on how well things ended up going last night is enough apply this same filter again and again over hundreds of thousands of years and natural selection will shape us all into finely engineered collaborative learning machines which is what we humans actually are so i suspect that must be exactly what really happened if thats how sex fits into the new evolutionary picture now that we know that it should be possible to answer my opening questions why are men and women so different why isnt intercourse the easiest way for a woman to have an orgasm why does human sex sometimes last so long why does it often involve cultural practices that have nothing to do with fertilization pregnancy and nursing are biologically expensive women have every reason to be more choosey than men to screen their partners more carefully for the teachability and creativity their children will need to get by in a human society men make these choices too but theyre not as crucial to their survival if human sex consisted of intercourse and nothing else this asymmetry in the value of information to the two sexes makes it seem likely that it just wouldnt last long enough to provide women with all of the information they might require since there are other ways of pleasing them however men who are good learners can learn to provide the additional information both men and women are beautiful sing dance tell jokes etc so were clearly one of the species in which both sexes display still i might be wrong about this its easy to see how i could be but i think men have the more complex learning task when it comes to sex they have to figure out that what comes most easily isnt always best they have to develop a set of physical skills not unlike those required to play a musical instrument and they have to learn to control themselves and delay gratification it seems to me that women must have the ability to have multiple orgasms separated by long intervals of high arousal simply because that leaves more room for different degrees of sexual satisfaction their sexuality is set up to give them more information about their partners because they need information more the competition to please them that would have resulted from this general way of arranging things could have produced our complicated human kind of sex in the same way competition to attract peahens produced the complex tail of the peacock because it involves culture human sex is openended nature doesnt try to guess what well invent it just sets out this huge blank canvas and lets us collaboratively paint whatever we can think of onto it the standard of success isnt biologically fixed its just a matter of what our competitors have come up with theres no hard upper limit on the number of orgasms a human woman can have because theres no hard upper limit on human creativity so unlike lloyds story this one has a moral if wed all just kept on having hasty boring completely instinctive sex like chimpanzees im not sure human intelligence itself could ever have evolved but in fact were lucky enough be human beings and not chimpanzees so we should learn to enjoy it be eager to learn and easy to teach take pleasure in your work be creative take your time become a good ensemble player youll put thousands of hours into learning how to do much less important things like playing the guitar why on earth wouldnt a human male put a similar effort into learning to be really good at oral sex whether you know it or not youre participating in a contest the palm is likely to go to someone who knows hes competing a young man in particular should practice this skill at every opportunity theres a useful book by ian kerner called she comes first for those of us who want to improve ourselves as all men should but personally i love the classics decades after its original publication the joy of sex is still a good place to start since christmas is approaching im tempted to say that these books might make good stocking stuffers but the male ego is so fragile that some delicacy is required on the part of the giver who must somehow insinuate that shes just trying to improve an already awesome performance whether thats true or not to be offended by such a gift would be extremely stupid no matter how good you think you already are its the very nature of human sexuality that we can always learn to do more thats whats so fun about it we dont know how people will be having sex a hundred or a hundred thousand years from now but theres one thing im sure of it will always be an endlessly exciting challenge learning to participate in a pleasing manner isnt an unimportant marginal task its a central part of the whole human adaptation something we couldnt have become what we are without and our lives would be better if male human beings in particular took the challenge more seriously so to my fellow men as yuletide approaches i can only repeat the immortal words of bullwinkle j moose excelsior excelsior youre not a chimpanzee in the year thats coming and all the years after that try to learn how to not make love like one daniel cloud

health high blood pressure medically known as hypertension affects 73 million americans a common misconception is that those with hypertension are excessively nervous or stressed out in my practice this is actually one of the most common questions that i am asked by a new patient so ill say it publicly hypertension is a disease you cannot develop hypertension by being stressed out numerous studies have examined animals and humans subjected to stress and have not found that stress leads to hypertension although it contains the word tension what hypertension really means is that you have blood pressure high enough to cause damage to your organs blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps blood if this pressure rises and stays high over time it can damage the kidneys heart and blood vessels without any symptoms when kidneys are injured by elevated blood pressure the result can be progressive kidney failure your kidneys arent the only organs hurt by hypertension the heart and blood vessels can be targets as well when high blood pressure damages the heart it leads to enlargement and congestive heart failure the brain is damaged by strokes in patients with hypertension blood vessels are damaged forming aneurysms that may burst and blood vessels in the eyes can be damaged to cause blindness as is the case with so many other problems you may have your parents to blame most commonly hypertension is inherited if you have the genetics the older you are the more likely you are to develop hypertension hypertension can also be caused by underlying diseases such as kidney disease so chronic kidney disease can be both a cause and effect of hypertension excess dietary salt intake can also cause hypertension hypertension is also associated with weight gain and obesity hardening of the arteries diabetes sleep apnea and can be caused by many drugs as well as alcohol so take a deep breath and do try to manage your stress but know that its not the root cause of your hypertension what is the ideal blood pressure number the systolic blood pressure is the top number on your blood pressure recording and this is the pressure that your heart generates with each beat the diastolic blood pressure is the bottom number which is the basic resting blood pressure in your vessels at the end of a heartbeat the target blood pressure for control should be 13080 in some cases we recommend a blood pressure to be controlled to 12575 some elderly patients and people with hardening of the arteries will have an elevated systolic blood pressure only we pay the most attention to the systolic blood pressure because that is the pressure that is most associated with organ damage hypertension is diagnosed when blood pressure is elevated above 14090 on at least three different occasions at least three months apart your blood pressure should be taken while you are seated for at least five minutes with your arm resting it should be taken in both arms but the nondominant arm should usually be used so if you are right handed it is best to record your blood pressure in your left arm the blood pressure should be recorded as the average of at least two recordings if there is a difference between your two arms the highest blood pressure should generally be recorded how do i treat hypertension without drugs before popping pills to treat high blood pressure consider making healthy lifestyle changes some of my recommendations include you have probably heard about the phenomenon known as office or white coat hypertension this diagnosis is made when someone has normal blood pressures at home but high blood pressure when recorded in the doctors office or another health care setting this type of hypertension does not necessarily need to be treated but it should be carefully followed with home blood pressure recordings what if my blood pressure cannot be kept under control with lifestyle changes there are many drugs that doctors use to control blood pressure your doctor usually selects the one or two that fit your risk vs benefit profile each patient is unique and each treatment plan

technology my personal passion for innovation and tech geek girl alert has lead me to try and push financial services firms from a stoneage mentality about technology toward the jetsonsera approach taken by most other industries i have long held that financial services firms tend to see technology spends as merely expense items rather than the revenue generators that they can be in other words they will only invest in new tech when the old stuff is kaput rather than imagine how making investments in new technologies early might give them an edge over the competition its an attitude born out of a financial services culture that privileges rigidity and sticking with the status quo but that culture has to change today there is extra urgency behind the need for a shift toward innovation many new financial services competitors that are small nimble and on the cutting edge of technology entered the market right after the financial crisis when established firms were busy licking their wounds the old guard is going to need to stay on top of innovation just to keep up with the new guard when the hong kong trade development council hktdc invited me to attend the asian financial forum in hong kong a few weeks ago i got a chance to hear firsthand what kind of thinking on financial services innovation is happening in asia the hktdc has more than 40 offices globally to promote offshore and existing business in hong kong mainland china and all of asia the asian financial forum is the largest financial services conference in asia boasting over 2000 attendees over 100 distinguished speakers from the private sector and public sectorboth business people and policy makers about four out of five of the participants were ceolevel or other csuite executives the conference also drew more than 500 journalists from 39 countries there was one session that caught my eye immediately financial services innovation workshop sponsored by deloitte i thought financial services innovation was that an oxymoron i was eager to hear what fresh ideas the executives on the panel from deloitte china aia insurance and the shanghai lujiazui international financial asset exchange among others might be able to offer here are a few key points they made that really had an impact on me and could have a big impact on you and your business independent innovation teams to foster the conditions in which real innovation will occur financial services firms must create innovation teams that are independent made up of industry outsiders and given room to fail this also means giving them the resources they need to try things that may fail give an innovation team enough budget enough autonomy to take some risks to fail learn from their failure and not be punished for their failure and just try some really new things said simeon preston group chief strategy and operations officer aia insurance preston warned that if the aias innovation incubator were housed within the larger firm of aia antibodies might destroy the groups efforts to innovate gregory gibb chairman shanghai lujiazui international financial asset exchange co said similarly that firms must try and innovate first and push riskcompliance to the end of the process otherwise innovative ideas will never get off the ground customerfocused innovation financial services firms are very transactionfocused but they need to pivot to a customer focus when it comes to innovation said preston firms must try to generate new ideas that will benefit the customer first rather than deciding what works best for the institution and stuffing customers needs into the model after the fact he said some innovations will work great in certain markets but not others for example customers need to be served the way that they want to whether it be inperson or digitallyas in over email mobile or skype said tim pagett of deloitte china that means a hybrid approach preston agreed in the past firms would demonstrate their stability and size by the number of branches they had in local markets now some see a large branch network as an expense rather than a strength said preston we remain committed to providing you with the

of siloed teams and we need to invent it here mentality does not encourage innovation said christopher harvey global industry leader of financial servicesdeloitte he said that separate yet networked and collaborative units would create more agility to adjust to change when necessary further todays banks and other financial services firms have grown outward into providing more services rather than teaming with best in class providers to create a kind of innovation grid said harvey financial services firms must decide what their core competencies are harvey said and then create partnerships in areas where they are weaker to achieve this networked world mobilesocialvirtual world some of greatest innovations down the line will likely occur in mobile payments crowdfundinglending virtual currencies and alternative payment systems like paypal and alipay said gibb he argued that even mobile payments were becoming passe and that in the future cell phones could serve not just as communication devices but as identification and currency this would cut down the steps between payor and payee he conjectured that the financial services business model of the future would be a tech firm that offered financial services products regardless the future of financial services looks bold and brightfor those firms that can embrace innovationchange to be nimble and agile this is a sea change that financial services firms need to get comfortable with sooner rather than later
science the united kingdom leaving the european union would spell bad news for the global science community according to a winner of the 2016 nobel prize in chemistry sir fraser stoddart a scottish chemist who teaches at northwestern university attributes his nobel win to international collaboration between scientists science is global he told bbc world service newshour on wednesday i am sitting here with this prize associated with my name but it really is pinned onto the names of another 20 30 40 different nationalities stoddart shares the 2016 prize with jeanpierre sauvage of france and bernard feringa of the netherlands together they discovered tiny molecular machines he said his early career was defined by the uk welcoming young scientists from across europe today i am distressed by the fact that the uk is looking at a situation that would cut off that supply he said this is not good news for scientists in the uk i would hope that this whole business of brexit would either go away or just did not happen brits voted in june to leave the eu brexit critics however fear future social consequences which may include tougher immigration policies i would not be surprised if you see the most able scientists in the country leave stoddart said science is a global pursuit it must allow people to come and go across different cultures from different countries
worldnews washington reuters washington and moscow have over decades established mechanisms to prevent crises from spinning out of control from hotlines to satellites and overflights that allow the nucleararmed adversaries to track each others military deployments no such safety nets exist between washington and pyongyang worrying experts who say an accident misstatement or erroneous reading by one side of the others actions could spiral into fullscale conflict even though neither side wants war tensions have risen markedly in the past few days after north korea warned washington of a severe lesson following un action against it and us president donald trump in turn warning that any threats to the united states from pyongyang would be met with fire and fury trumps unexpected remarks prompted north korea to respond by saying it was considering plans for a missile strike on the us pacific territory of guam experts said there are limited channels through which the two sides can try to exchange proposals to ease tensions over north koreas missile and nuclear weapons programs we have some ad hoc and analogue ways of communicating with north korea but we dont have anything that has proven itself and can withstand the stress of crises said jon wolfsthal a top nonproliferation adviser to former president barack obama the two sides have no diplomatic relations so they have no embassies in each others capitals they maintain contacts through their united nations missions their embassies in beijing and meetings between military officers at panmunjom the location on the militarized frontier dividing the korean peninsula where the truce that stilled the 195053 korean war was signed washington also passes messages through pyongyangs ally and neighbor china or sweden the us protecting power in pyongyang there was a hotline linking seoul and pyongyang but north korean leader kim jong un severed the channel in 2013 and refused to restore it said gary samore a former senior white house adviser now with harvard universitys belfer center for science and international affairs you cant handle this crisis through tweets and public statements said joseph cirincione president of the ploughshares fund an arms control group referring to trumps penchant for using twitter to deliver policy announcements even india and pakistan both nucleararmed have a set of basic agreements designed to reduce the risk of an accidental war and a commitment not to attack each others nuclear sites in february the arch rivals who are steadily expanding their nuclear weapon and missile programs renewed a pact to inform each other of accidents involving nuclear weapons for another five years so that there was no misinterpretation the two countries exchange a list of their nuclear sites each january as part of a 1998 agreement not to attack those facilities because of the risk of radiation to population centers however experts say india and pakistan need to take further nuclear confidencebuilding measures because tensions remain high it took years during the cold war for washington and moscow to establish hotlines and develop protocols by which their presidents and top officials could verify that the person with whom they were in contact was who they said they were due to a lack of trust wolfsthal said the challenge was first how to establish direct contact presidenttopresident militarytomilitary and then how to make sure they would be reliable safe and secure in the case of a conflict he said how would they verify the identities of people this is

join us once again those protocols are still in use and have become arguably more important in an era of cyberwarfare washington and moscow have also established newer channels for instance they use a deconfliction channel in syria where they are both conducting military operations to ensure they do not come into conflict even so there were incidents during the cold war that brought washington and moscow close to the brink of war mainly because of early warning system glitches said lisbeth grolund of the union of concerned scientists an arms control organization in one case in the soviet union they got a warning that an attack was underway everything looked real but the person on the scene there decided to disobey orders and not tell his boss she said and it was a good thing because it was not an attack their satellite had seen a reflection off of the clouds

social my son 15 years old and normally bounding with energy sits blearyeyed at our kitchen counter studying before dinner after a quick meal zak will trudge upstairs to slog through several additional hours of homework only to get up early the next morning to do more this bleak routine is repeated daily in households across the country in a recent survey students at highperforming california high schools said they average more than three hours of homework a nightand thats after spending seven hours at school and perhaps another two or three at soccer practice or band nationwide adolescents and teens are routinely grinding through 10 or 12hour days theyre sacrificing a decent nights sleep exercise family time a social life and spare moments to simply read invent dream or exploreeverything thats essential to a growing mind headaches stomachaches sleeplessness and depression rates among teens are soaring now exasperated parents across california are finally speaking up to say enough the effort began at burbanks john burroughs high school where pta members took action after seeing our film race to nowhere suzanne weerts and tina mcdermott both mothers at the high school delved into the education research and drafted a resolution titled homework quality over quantity urging schools to get the homework madness under control this month the california pta adopted their resolution statewide state representatives aim to take it to the national pta next year we know from the research that too much homework can have a negative impact on learning said tina mcdermott who also teaches at a community college we also know that family stress can skyrocket from the relentless pressure every day to get it done it can impact the entire family even parents i dont know very well have come up and given me a hug suzanne weerts told the glendale newspress thats a clear indication that the initiative touched even those who felt too helpless to fight back i applaud these parents efforts theyve created a crucial opportunity for dialogue about the consequences of our outofcontrol homework habit and theyve modeled the kind of grassroots campaign thats essential to creating change in each community now we must use this opportunity to push homework reform even further the california pta resolution rightly calls for homework thats reasonable relevant and reinforcing rather than the busywork students typically bring home but thats really only part of the equation more urgent is the need to substantially limit homework so as to reclaim our childrens most precious resource time the truth is it doesnt much matter if homework is meaningful if theres no time to do it relevant and reinforcing are also empty promises if homework takes time away from family dinner a full nights sleep friendships and unscheduled hours when curiosity and personal passions can be cultivated these are our childrens fleeting formative years they need free time not sevenday workweeks spent hunched over assignments to pursue the interests and relationships that account for the richness of our world and that help them grow into whole human beings our society is increasingly questioning the overtimefrenzy sleepingunderthedesk attitude that once defined adult success in the american workforce its time we do the same for youth so heres an item to add to the pta resolution homework should be completely eliminated in the elementary grades and severely curtailed in middle and high school even then it should be assigned as an exception not a rule our healthy homework guidelines spell out what kind of homework is most valuable only then will schools be honoring the time that rightfully belongs to a child and her family that right was severely impinged upon in our household on a recent weekend when i took my two high schoolers into san francisco for brunch with my oldest child who was home from college for the first time since winter break zak and jamey had already spent the morning working with their math tutor and as i drove zak pored over study words for a vocabulary test while jamey outlined an english paper they felt they couldnt afford to take a full two hours off of homework for the family outing as they asked me for help with their assignments i grew so frustrated and distracted that i ended up in the wrong part of a city that i know quite well here on a sunday morning i couldnt even chat with my children about life and the world around us we didnt have the breathing room to get excited about all being together for the first time in months this was nuts still the obstacles to change are formidable as the burbank parents know only too well though their school district formed a homework task force more than a year ago internal politics have prevented the group from finalizing a plan and the district watered down the groups original proposal for a homework policy to mere guidelineschanges that are suggested but not required weerts tells me much of the resistance has come from union reps concerned about teachers professional autonomy in other school districts teachers balk at limiting homework because they feel the usual schoolday schedule doesnt leave enough time to cover required content and homework bridges the gap this kind of resistance is common and yet research shows theres no connection between extreme hours of homework and student learning and thus nothing to lose by curbing excessive assignments we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you

holiday breaks scores of schools have tackled the schedule problem by switching to more sensible block schedules and integrated curricula that allow students to practice concepts during the day not at home at san diegos renowned high tech high ninth graders have minimal evening work provided they use their time effectively during the day and at hillcrest school in oakland calif administrators did away with homework in the elementary grades these schools show us that it takes comprehensive policy changebeyond mere guidelinesto shift the culture of homework weve come to embrace across america the california parents pressing our schools for sanity are taking the first bold step and the california pta resolution theyve set in motion deserves our support when we finally pulled up at the cafe

science by wynne parry livescience senior writer published 04272012 0521 pm edt on livescience rats and their close relatives including mice make up nearly a quarter of known mammal species new research offers a clue to these rodents success their bite rodents have evolved two feeding modes gnawing with their incisors and chewing with their molars farther back in their mouths however they cannot do both at the same time some such as squirrels and beavers have specialized in gnawing others such as guinea pigs and porcupines have specialized in chewing others a group called myomorphs that includes rats and mice have taken the middle road by staying flexible and adapted to doing both at different times to find out whether rats could outbite other rodents a team of scientists from the united kingdom france and japan used computer models to simulate the bites of rodents they also wanted to find out whether it was the rats skull shape or its jaw muscles that gave it an extraordinary bite so they created virtual animals with characteristics from different biters such as a rat skull with squirrel muscles not surprisingly they found that squirrels can more efficiently apply force with their bite muscles when gnawing than can guinea pigs while guinea pigs can chew with their molars more efficiently than squirrels this makes sense considering that squirrels gnaw on a diet of nuts and seeds while guinea pigs eat grasses but rats turned out to be more efficient at gnawing and chewing than the other rodents the results showed the way rat muscles have adapted over time has increased their ability to chew more effectively than a guinea pig and gnaw better than a squirrel even though these two species are specialists in these kinds of jaw movements study researcher nathan jeffery of the university of liverpool said in a statement this goes some way to explaining why rats and mice are so successful as well as destructive as their versatile feeding behavior allows them to eat through a wide variety of materials efficiently the researchers detailed their work yesterday april 27 in the journal plos one you can follow livescience writer wynne parry on twitter wynneparry follow livescience for the latest in science news and discoveries on twitter livescience and on facebook we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again
economy several male supervisors at a verizoncontracted warehouse in memphis tennessee groped sexually propositioned and harassed eight current and former female employees according to charges the women filed last month at the equal employment opportunity commission the federal agency that handles civil rights employment cases one woman says her boss at the fulfillment center where workers pack and ship verizon products came by to offer her a peppermint dropped it in her hand then reached down and grabbed her breast another womans boss grabbed her buttocks while he was walking by with a colleague according to her complaint after she reported the incident to the human resources department her boss treated her more harshly and wrote her up for not working falsely she says in the complaint she quit in january filed in two batches at the eeoc in early and late april the charges show what pervasive systemic sexual harassment looks like for lowwage workers of color the warehouse workers are primarily african american who are often an afterthought in the recent spate of me too stories which tend to focus on highprofile men and more elite typically white women while the first batch of charges got some local press attention the discrimination claims filed in late april have not been previously reported in this case the discrimination charges were not filed against verizon nor do they involve the companys employees instead workers have filed their claims against their direct employer xpo logistics a multibilliondollar global firm that owns the warehouse and contracts with verizon these eight women are just the tip of the iceberg there are so many more everybody in there is being mistreated and overworked on wednesday ahead of verizons shareholder meeting the national womens law center a womens economic rights nonprofit and four other groups sent a letter to verizon ceo and chairman lowell mcadam urging him to address complaints of sexual harassment at the memphis facility other signers include the womens nonprofit a better balance the tennessee branch of the naacp and sisterreach a womens rights nonprofit that is focused of women of color in the south the president of sagaftra a union that represents actors singers and other entertainers also signed on the xpo warehouse reportedly exhibits a toxic culture that runs contrary to verizons stated policies and practices says the letter provided exclusively to huffpost on tuesday the letter notes that mcadam has been a vocal supporter of womens rights the ceo recently proclaimed a zero tolerance policy for harassment at makers a womens conference run by verizonowned oath oath is also huffposts parent company as community leaders and womens rights advocates engaged in legal and policy work to fight against sexual harassment and active in the times up and metoo campaigns and movements we are deeply concerned with how verizon ensures safe and dignified working conditions for the workers in its supply chain the letter says the writers ask for a meeting with verizon to further discuss the situation huffpost alerted verizon to the letter on tuesday night the company said this was the first it heard about the situation in memphis we are undertaking an immediate investigation into the matter verizon spokesman bob varettoni told huffpost on wednesday after looking at the charges later that day lawyers from both companies met to discuss the allegations according to a letter sent to xpo from verizon broadly outlining their discussion and next steps these are very disturbing and serious allegations verizons attorneys write verizon expects xpo logistics to utilize all measures available to fully investigate the charges and take prompt and decisive remedial action if the facts warrant it verizon also said that it expects frequent updates on the investigation and that it will monitor xpos actions the updates and investigation will inform the basis of any decisions verizon makes regarding the future of our contractual relationship with xpo the letter was addressed to two xpo executives including inhouse lawyer richard valitutto according to the harassment charges valitutto was also employed by the warehouses previous owners new breed logistics when it was sued for sexual harassment in 2010 the company lost that case and a judge ordered the warehouse to closely monitor for sexual harassment issues its not clear what happened after that a spokesman for xpo declined to comment on the specifics of the claims but said that the company had only reviewed the charges filed in early april and had not yet seen the late april filings our culture promotes safety and respect we have no tolerance for any form of harassment an xpo spokesman told huffpost we promptly investigate all claims brought to our attention the charges raise questions about the responsibilities big companies have in dealing with the behavior of their contractors its a struggle thats somewhat analogous to what happens in the retail industry where big labels outsource manufacturing overseas other tech firms including facebook do hold their contractors to various standards including minimum wages and benefits requirements many including verizon say they have zero tolerance for harassment at any firm they do business with those kind of policies will increasingly be put to the test as the me too movement matures its possible that the next phase will spread to these fairly common arrangements where bigname companies outsource labor needs to us companies with a far lower profile part of this moment demands greater accountability for preventing and addressing workplace harassment said emily martin general counsel at the national womens law center which has signed on to the letter companies like verizon should pay attention not only to the treatment of their own workers but also to those who fall under their corporate umbrella she said they have a lot of power to make change verizon has a really important voice around the conversation they should use that power to stand up for the workers who are trying to seek justice said martin who also oversees some legal work for times up the antiharassment initiative created by women in hollywood in the wake of the me too movement the women who filed these claims are hourly workers who dont earn a lot of money and many are the sole breadwinners for their family grateful for the hourly work and fulltime benefits despite the hazards of the job said gloria sweetlove president of the naacp in tennessee which signed the letter the racial aspects of the harassment allegations are hard to miss as the female workers at the plant are mainly african american and their supervisors mostly white men according to the letter from the groups one woman alleging discrimination said her supervisor regularly made sexual comments to the women who worked under him calling one his chocolate baby theyre getting the same kind of racist pathetic treatment that people in the south got for generations said sweetlove who noted shes met with many workers inside the xpo facility where employees are often working long and inconsistent hours desperate to hang on to the fulltime work that comes with benefits a rarity for lowwage workers in memphis these eight women are just the tip of the iceberg there are so many more everybody in there is being mistreated and overworked she said the facilitys previous owner new breed logistics was sued by the eeoc in 2010 for harassment and retaliation involving three female temp workers in memphis a jury found in favor of the victims with a 15 million judgment a federal judge ordered the company to monitor complaints and issues going forward however while the case was on appeal xpo bought the facility verizon contracted with new breed as well we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your

economy san francisco reuters the us securities and exchange commission sec is pursuing a contempt order against tesla inc ceo elon musk saying he violated a fraud settlement by tweeting material information without preapproval sending the firms shares down 5 percent the secs request potentially could reopen a turbulent chapter for the electric vehicle maker in which regulators last year accused musk of fraud for making misleading tweets about plans to take the company private and demanded that he be stripped of his ceo title musk tesla and the sec settled the lawsuit and part of the settlement called for any material statements made by musk on social media to be vetted in advance by the company in a court filing on monday the regulator pointed to a musk feb 19 tweet tesla made 0 cars in 2011 but will make around 500k in 2019 noting that musk did not seek or receive preapproval before publishing this tweet which was inaccurate and disseminated to over 24 million people musk has thus violated the courts final judgment by engaging in the very conduct that the preapproval provision of the final judgment was designed to prevent the sec wrote in its motion filed on monday in federal court in manhattan the motion asks the judge to issue an order that would put the onus on musk to show why he should not be held in contempt for violating the settlement musk corrected his tweet four hours later to say that the annualised production rate at yearend 2019 would probably be about 500000 with deliveries expected to be about 400000 meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k ie 10k carsweek deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment but musk shot back on twitter on monday night tweeting sec forgot to read tesla earnings transcript which clearly states 350k to 500k how embarrassing musk was referring to comments made by him in january to analysts that tesla would make maybe on the order of 350000 to 500000 model 3s something like that this year tesla and musk agreed in september to pay 20 million each to the sec and the billionaire stepped down as the companys chairman but remained as chief executive in the settlement the agency pulled back from its original demand that musk who is synonymous with the tesla brand be barred from running tesla a sanction many investors said would be disastrous the settlement was approved by a us judge in october who can now decide whether its terms have been violated musk provoked the sec even after the settlement was signed calling the agency the shortseller enrichment commission on twitter in october in a december interview with 60 minutes musk said none of his tweets had been censored since the settlement and that only those that could cause tesla stock to move would need to be reviewed i want to be clear i do not have respect for the sec he said adding that he respected the justice system in its fourthquarter shareholder letter tesla said that barring unexpected challenges with the new shanghai factory tesla targeted annualised model 3 production of over 500000 units sometime between the fourth quarter and the second quarter of next year in a response to the secs demand for information regarding the feb 19 tweet a lawyer for tesla and musk said the ceos tweet was meant to reiterate information already approved then disseminated when the company released fourthquarter earnings results in january although the tweet was not preapproved the lawyer wrote musk believed its substance had been appropriately vetted preapproved and publicly disseminated moreover the lawyer said the statement was made outside of market trading hours it was not immediately clear what the repercussions would be were musk to be found in contempt as such a citation does not necessarily mean the original agreement is now null and void the sec could seek a socalled bar order removing him from teslas board or could ask for a lesser penalty like a monetary fine said stephen diamond a professor of corporate governance at santa clara university the sec could also ask the court to reopen the original settlement for renegotiation he said perhaps asking that the original charges be reinstated its a pretty unusual situation diamond said adding that all bets are off teslas board has added new members as part of the settlement moves that some outsiders hope will increase oversight of musk board member robyn denholm also was made chairwoman after musk was stripped of that role but she has not

sports some myths and legends represent deeper truths about our lives and the world in a way that brings us closer to each other and to where we all want to go other myths take us further from the truth and get in the way of seeing reality or confusing us over the steps needed to move forward it is the myths of the latter that i have often written about in previous columns in politics in the aftermath or even in the midst of elections many myths are promulgated that take us further from the truth and darken a true view of reality and these then have deleterious effects on decision making in the present because they are a misread of what actually happened in 1992 and many years after the myth was repeated that ross perots independent candidacy cost president bush his reelection the truth was that bill clinton would have won by a bigger margin if perot had not run at all when one looks at exit polls and second choice responses as well as demographic breakdowns of his support the 2004 election carried with it many myths one big one being that president bush won reelection because of gay marriage initiatives being placed on state ballots causing an increase in conservative voter turnout the final results actually showed there was no difference in conservative turnout between target states that had gay marriage referendums and those states that didnt have them in the last few elections i have also attempted to show that television advertising in presidential elections has very little if any impact on election results and even though the media keeps reporting on the myth of the power of television ads as well as this myth being pushed by consultants on both sides of the aisle the state by state results show that advertising effects are minimal at best i have addressed this one with much more detail in a previous column many of us have also bought into myths in our personal relationships i like to call one of these the jerry maguire myth because it comes from the movie line of tom cruises character who says to his love interest you complete me while seemingly romantic it perpetuates the myth that somehow someone else will make us whole or complete us in way that fills a void we carry and will make us happy having gone through marriage and divorce very young and then remarriage and divorce again i finally figured out some truth of successful relationships it is that it is only when we fill the void in ourselves outside of another and that we no longer need a relationship for happiness that we are then finally ready for a healthy relationship and finally we arrive at a current myth related to the nfl and roger goodell in the midst of the domestic abuse scandals the myth has been repeated by nearly everyone that the owners wont fire goodell because he has done an outstanding job and brought all nfl teams a tremendous increase in financial value that goodell has been such an outstanding executive as represented by growth in value that the owners wont do the right thing and fire him as the espn site fivethirtyeight has pointed out the truth is quite different and the only thing overvalued is goodell himself under the previous nfl commissioner paul tagliabue nfl franchises grew at an annual rate of 117 percent under goodell since 2006 nfl franchises have grown at a comparatively paltry 35 percent and when compared with other leagues the growth of the nfl under goodell is dead last with a total growth of 32 percent over his tenure this compares at the same time to the nba at 65 percent mlb at 82 percent and the nhl at 114 percent what it appears goodell is good at is spinning positive press and a myth about himself to the media and to the owners themselves if the owners really are business people at heart and coldly look at the bottom line and really care about and love the game and want to represent the best of america showing goodell the door would indicate they have broken through the myth to the truth and when they figure out they no longer need the relationship with goodell they can then find the commissioner they really want and might help restore our trust and love of the game as i have learned personally and in politics and in watching the nfl quagmire over the last few weeks about buying into myths there is much truth in this quote from the brothers karamazov above all dont lie to yourself the man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him or around him and so loses all respect for himself and for others and having no respect he ceases to love we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful

social if senator anthony portantino gets his way california will be the first state in the nation to ensure that teenagers can go to school without sacrificing a good nights sleep this week he introduced sb328 a bill that would require california school districts to start middle and high school classes no earlier than 830 am every year we discuss as parents educators and legislators best practices and interests of the children and education says portantino well data is clear starting the school day later improves the quality of education health and welfare of our children so lets do it the average school day for middle and high school students in california starts at 807 am with commute times considerably earlier these veryearly hours were established largely to save money on bus costs before schools understood teen sleep needs and patterns according to the centers for disease control more than 4 in 5 american secondary schools start the day before 830 am with nearly 10 of high schools requiring attendance before 730 am the result is a public health and equity issue right up there with child labor smoking and seatbelts according to the nonprofit advocacy organization start school later which full disclosure i cofounded and now direct restoring more traditional school start times as recommended by the american academy of pediatrics aap the american medical association ama the us centers for disease control cdc and other medical and education experts is a practical and necessary solution with broad and immediate benefits for children of all ages start school later has nearly 90 chapters across the usa including a statewide california chapter led by irena keller phd adjunct professor of child and adolescent development at san jose state university and local chapters in chico los angeles redlands and san diego if passed portantinos bill will ensure that the more than 3 million public middle and high students in california can go to school at times that allow them to get a healthy nights sleep have time for breakfast commute to school after sunrise and arrive at school ready to learn it would also be a model for many other states and municipalities around the country that have been unable to restore developmentally appropriate school hours on their own local school districts must of course set their specific schedules however in many districts local resistance prevents school leaders from acting on the strong body of scientific evidence showing that sleep and school hours that allow for healthy sleep are critical to health safety and academic achievement those who want help might also benefit from an upcoming national conference on teen sleep and school start times which includes leaders from districts that have navigated this change successfully parameters for developmentally appropriate school hours would be consistent with the many other state regulations for local districts including requirements about the number of days and hours students must be in class to date however no state has provided clear guidelines for safe healthy school hours although maryland and new jersey recently passed legislation to study or incentivize later school start times last year maryland passed the orange ribbon for healthy schools bill to create a nocost incentive program to recognize districts moving to later bell times at the federal level california congresswoman zoe lofgren has also repeatedly introduced versions of a zzzs to as bill and resolution to the us congress all unsuccessful to date proposing limits on the hours at which american high schools can begin required instruction a large broad and consistent body of evidence shows that moving middle and high school bell times later gives more students more and better sleep and reduces rates of sleeping in class mood swings depression stimulant and illegal drug use and car crashes as well as suspensions tardies absences and dropouts just this month a new study of 30000 teenagers across 29 schools in 7 states showed that two years after moving bell times to 830 or later the average graduation rate moved from 79 to 88 according to study author pamela mckeever edd the studys findings linking later bell times to improved attendance and graduation rates raise questions for school officials about whether later start times are a mechanism for closing the achievement gap in california as in many states improved attendance would also benefit districts financially because school funding is tied to attendance by improving current attendance by just 1 the los angeles unified school district would gain an estimated 40 million per year funds that could be reinvested in schools to benefit students note an earlier version of this article was

politics a proposal to protect abortion rights in michigan is back on the november ballot thanks to the states supreme court the proposal would amend michigans constitution codifying an array of reproductive rights that are currently in jeopardy thanks to this summers us supreme court decision overruling roe v wade with roe no longer in force states have the power to pass new laws prohibiting abortion or to enforce old bans that are still on the books the latter is an especially real possibility in michigan where a 1931 law prohibits abortion at any stage of pregnancy and in almost all circumstances the law is not being enforced at the moment thanks to several lower court rulings that prevent prosecutors from bringing cases but abortion rights opponents have appealed those decisions the goal of the abortion rights amendment is to settle these questions once and for all so that neither judges nor lawmakers could take away abortion access in michigan and that idea appears to have a great deal of support in july organizers submitted petitions supporting the amendment with more than 750000 signatures from across the state that was nearly twice as many as necessary and consistent with the strong support for abortion rights among michiganders that recent polling has detected but opponents of the measure said those petitions were not valid because of what was basically a series of typos spaces between some of the words were not readily visible thanks to a glitch in the printing this made the petitions incomprehensible opponents claimed and thus not valid as proof the amendment had enough support to qualify for the ballot last week that argument prevailed with the two republicans who sit on michigans fourperson election board the two republicans voted against authorizing the amendment producing a deadlock along party lines if that had been the final word the amendment would not be on the november ballot but immediately after the elections board voted the amendments supporters asked the state supreme court to intervene arguing that the meaning of the amendment was clear even with the compressed words and that the elections board had no authority to block an initiative when it so clearly had enough public support on thursday the court agreed that the amendments meaning was clear and ordered the election board to certify the amendment the board next meets on friday which is also the deadline for county clerks to finalize november ballot designs the vote on the sevenmember court was 52 and in a brief unsigned opinion the majority explained that the meaning of the words has not changed by the alleged insufficient spacing between them but several justices chimed in with more thoughts including chief justice bridget mary mccormack who was part of the majority and wrote a stinging concurring opinion seven hundred fifty three thousand and seven hundred fifty nine michiganders signed this proposal more than have ever signed any proposal in michigans history mccormack wrote noting that the challengers produced no evidence that any voters were actually confused by the wording mccormack accused those opponents of trying to disenfranchise millions of michiganders because they think they have identified a technicality that allows them to do so a game of gotcha gone very bad justice brian zahra one of the two dissenters had some pointed words of his own he protested the decision to issue a ruling without oral argument then zeroed in on the substantive dispute and why in his opinion it mattered the only thing more difficult to discern than the disputed portions of the text of the amendment is why the proponents of the amendment proceeded to circulate a petition that plainly did not conform to the form and content of the petition preapproved by the bureau of elections zahra wrote the amendments placement on the ballot could have a significant effect on the outcome of other races by increasing turnout among voters who support abortion rights that is likely to help candidates who also support abortion rights including incumbent gov gretchen whitmer d and attorney general dana nessel d both of whom are up for reelection and have made abortion a central focus of their campaigns it could also help democrats seeking us house seats including several in tightly contested races whose outcomes could

than ever we hope you will join us once again the caveat is that the polls could be wrong the amendment might not be as popular as it seems or sentiments could change as opponents hammer away at it if that happens then the amendment could fail and its supporters running for office could lose which in the case of the governors race would mean a victory for republican tudor dixon dixon has said she supports the 1931 ban including its lack of exceptions for rape and incest if theres no new amendment in the state constitution and shes the one in the governors office then abortion might not be legal in michigan for much longer
politics ted cruz rtexas on saturday said he believes the us supreme court was overreaching and clearly wrong when it legalized samesex marriage across the country in the 2015 landmark obergefell v hodges decision cruz was speaking on his podcast about the differences between that case and the supreme courts recent decision that overturned roe v wade which had previously protected abortion rights nationwide he criticized the court for preventing individual states from deciding for themselves whether samesex marriage should be allowed obergefell like roe v wade ignored two centuries of our nations history marriage was always an issue that was left to the states he said in obergefell the court said no we know better than you guys do and now every state must sanction and permit gay marriage i think that decision was clearly wrong when it was decided it was the court overreaching cruz added that he personally doesnt expect the court to reverse its decision however reasoning that it would be more than a little chaotic based on the number of samesex marriages that have already legally taken place cruz has previously advocated for allowing individual states to outlaw samesex marriage for many his desire appears closer to a reality due to last months supreme court ruling on abortion rights in dobbs v jackson womens health organization which ignited concerns that the court might overturn other decisions justice clarence thomas amplified that concern stating in a solo concurring opinion that any decision made by the supreme court that was stated to be supported by the due process clause of the 14th amendment such as roe v wade was should be reconsidered we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again any substantive due process decision is demonstrably erroneous he said last month adding that we have a duty to correct the error established in those precedents other rulings citing the due process clause include griswold v connecticut which established the right for married couples to use contraception lawrence v texas which prohibits states from banning sexual relations between people of the same sex and loving v virginia which protects interracial marriage thomas mentioned the obergefell griswold and lawrence cases in his opinion but not did mention the loving case which if overturned could threaten his own interracial marriage
health do calories count for anything these days not according to jeff hamilton the president of prepared foods at nestle usa who has seen sales of lean cuisine meals plunge 20 percent in the last two years alone in a fascinating interview with fooddives david oliver hamilton argued that americans have lost their interest in cutting back on their caloric intake americans are just simply not dieting anymore hamilton told oliver as evidence of this idea oliver pointed to npd group surveys showing that the share of americans who say they are dieting has plummeted to 20 percent after hitting a high of 33 percent in 1991 to be clear hamilton does not say that americans have given up on trying to eat healthily theyve just shifted their focus to standards of healthfulness beyond calorie counting they care far more about avoiding ingredients that are perceived as unhealthy or unnatural nearly a third of all americans for example are trying to avoid gluten and 57 percent say that they prefer to buy foods free of gmos theyve also become notably interested in eating more protein there are a couple different ways you could look at this trend on the one hand yoyo dieting has been linked to a host of harmful consequences both physical and psychological and experts such as michael pollan have often warned that focusing on calories can be reductive and selfdefeating they argue that a smarter path to health is to think more holistically about the foods we eat and to emphasize whole natural foods instead of chemicalladen diet foods including lean cuisine frozen meals yet its not clear that americans are actually following the advice of people like pollan many americans after all seldom cook food from scratch and they still eat far less vegetables than they ought so if americans arent acting on their shifting health preferences by cooking more broccoli what are they doing theyre asking packaged food companies like nestle and restaurant chains like taco bell to remove artificial ingredients and gluten from their products theyre calling for mandatory labels on foods containing gmos theyre demanding dairyfree ice creams theyre eating greek yogurt all other things being equal thats fine but it can be problematic if americans equate healthy eating with the avoidance of stigmatized ingredients because little scientific evidence supports the idea that ingesting gmos and artificial flavorings is harmful to human health that gluten is bad for people without celiac disease or gluten intolerance or that were not eating enough protein while a great deal of scientific evidence supports the idea that eating too many calories can make you gain weight and that being too heavy endangers your health correction this post originally referred to the author of the fooddive interview with jeff hamilton as david owens his name is david oliver follow us on pinterest like us on facebook follow us on twitter
science gentoo penguin and chick in potter cove king george island it should be said that stephen roberts a researcher with the british antarctic survey and his colleagues from several european universities germanys bremen university the polish academy of sciences and cardiff university among others did not set out to solve a mystery or at least not one about the largest colonies of gentoo penguins in antarctica but a new study released today in the journal nature communications suggests that they stumbled upon a real caper roberts and company went to antarctica to collect lake bed sediments which give us regional insights into the historical impacts of climate change gentoo penguins excreting guano onto the snow near in potter cove king george island its relevant we swear we know the broader scale picture of past climate change say the last 10 or 12000 years on a global basis based on a lot of the ice core records said roberts but a lot of the impacts that might happen in certain places are kind of regional changes because we have a lot more lakes than ice sheets in a lot of areas were able to reconstruct the temperatures from a lot more places with techniques such as this while analyzing lake sediments from antarcticas ardley island they stumbled upon an unexpected bounty penguin bones the original purpose of the study wasnt to go there to find the history of the penguin colony on ardley island it was for relative sea level change said roberts but having found the bones and having found some very disparate patterns of geochemistry in the core sample we thought itd be an interesting thing to investigate a bit further cientists had known for a while that gentoo penguins which have lived on ardley island for 6700 years have periodically experienced sharp population declines gentoo penguins which currently number around 5000 pairs on ardley island are identifiable from other penguins by a white patch on their black feathers that begins behind their eye and wraps around connecting behind the crown similarly while other antarctic penguins like the adelie spend much of their time on frozen pieces of antarctic sea ice the gentoo penguinswhich are the northernmost antarctic penguinsspend much of their time on dry land historical records show that the gentoo population has declined precipitously five times over the past 6700 years but not all of the declines were correlated with climate changes and broader environmental effects the lake sediment provided a muchneeded clue roughly 62 miles southeast of ardley island lies the ominouslynamed deception island so called because from the outside it looks like a normal island but slip through a passageway into its interior and youll discover that its actually a ring the inner waterway is in fact the flooded caldera of a large active volcano the researchers geochemical analyses of the lake sediment sample which included a new kind of biological marking technique to reconstruct the changes through time and which looked at the varying concentration of guano or penguin poop and volcanic ash helped uncover a tragic truth each time deception islands volcano had a sizable eruption the resulting fallout was enough to almost completely wipe out ardley islands penguin population the location of ardley island and deception island in antarctica oblique aerial view of ardley island taken during helicopter uplift from fildes peninsula raised beaches can be seen in the foreground with ardley lake located in the topcentre of the photograph this study reveals the severe impact volcanic eruptions can have on penguins and just how difficult it can be for a colony to fully recover claire waluda a penguin ecologist for the british antarctic survey said in a statement an eruption can bury penguin chicks in abrasive and toxic ash and whilst the adults can swim away the chicks may be too young to survive in the freezing waters suitable nesting sites can also be buried and may remain uninhabitable for hundreds of years gentoo penguins climbing slopes to the nesting colony on ardley island we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone

years for their numbers to rebound are subjects for future research but the study is a sobering reminder of how seemingly distant events can have catastrophic effects that linger for centuries and this unfortunate past might not stay buried the penguin populations wiped out by historical eruptions were about the same size as the one that exists today and the volcano is still active this article

sports the los angeles dodgers preseason favorites according to most baseball analysts and experts are currently in first place in the nl west and have the best record in baseball after beating the arizona diamondbacks in a two game opening series in australia significantly this year the dodgers have passed the new york yankees in payroll making them the highest paid team in baseball for the dodgers who lost in the nlcs last year to the st louis cardinals the pressure to win this year is strong and made stronger by an aggressive new ownership committed to doing whatever it can financially to make the dodgers win the dodgers are in a pennant drought that by the standards of their team is historic between 1941 and 1988 the dodgers represented the national league in the world series fully one third of the time even in the decades preceding 1941 the dodgers occasionally won the pennant however since 1988 a period of more than 25 years the dodgers have not made it back to the world series for many of these years they were not bad finishing over 500 19 times and making it as far as the nlcs thrice the dodgers are a very good team this year their starting pitching led by the games best pitcher clayton kershaw as well as other standouts such as hyunjin ryu and zack greinke is excellent their bullpen in this age of deep bullpens is certainly good enough their lineup should be among the best in the league despite question marks at second base and catcher the dodgers are favorites for a reason but as with all favorites things could go wrong teams that spend a lot of money are almost always older teams the dodgers are not an exception yasiel puig is the only significant offensive contributor who will be under 30 this year second baseman dee gordon will be 26 but he has not distinguished himself offensively during parts of his last three seasons with the team additionally key players like matt kemp and hanley ramirez have lost large amounts of time to injuries over the last few years it is not hard to see how age and injuries could become a problem for this team over the course of the season puig was one of the best and most exciting players in baseball last year but has already begun to clash with dodger manager don mattingly this may amount to nothing but if this conflict leads to a poor season by puig the dodgers chances will suffer accordingly the dodgers are also heavily dependent on three players kershaw puig and ramirez who combined for more than war in 2013 a number that is more significant than it seems because puig and ramirez combined for only 190 games if any of these players do not perform as well as they did in 2013 something that is a particular concern given kershaws very recent injury related issues the dodgers could very quickly reveal themselves a surprisingly lacking in depth these are the kinds of problems all teams face similar narrative identifying potential pitfalls could be crafted for all contending teams the dodgers however like the team they have just passed for highest payroll in the game tare trying to build a champion by investing heavily in highly paid veterans either through trades or free agency at a time when the rest of baseball is moving in a different direction this means that if they fail to win this year the dodgers will have few options but to invest in more free agents and expensive veterans in a market where there are fewer top level free agents every year however acquiring more expensive and aging veterans through free agency or trades is not a good strategy for an already old team the dodgers are a good team that narrowly missed the world series last year and has a good chance to get at least that far again but there are no guarantees and much that could go wrong for the team between now and october they have become a contender through strong international signings a farm system that has developed one of the very best players in the game but most significantly an ability to take on contracts like those of carl crawford and adrian gonzalez that other teams do not want and by signing free agents as needed this is the model that the yankees began to use after their 19962000 run with mixed results the dodgers are employing that same strategy in a much more difficult context they could get a few breaks and win it all as the yankees did in 2009 but those eight years from 20012008 when the yankees missed every year and kept spending more money on free agents could well be a more likely scenario for the dodgers we remain committed to providing you with

economy on july 2 texas gov greg abbott r issued a statewide mask requirement to dampen a surge in coronavirus cases under the order most texans would have to cover their faces when entering buildings open to the public like grocery stores the following day managers at a sprouts farmers market in texas received a memo related to the new policy when it came to customers who refused to mask up the mandate wouldnt be a mandate after all if customer doesnt have a mask we offer them one if customer still refuses let them shop stated the july 3 memo a copy of which was provided to huffpost we are not kicking out customers who dont have a face covering that is not sprouts policy a sprouts spokesperson told huffpost the company implemented a strict requirement for masks the following week on july 11 the policy applies to the chains 300 stores nationwide and is posted at entrances for customers to see the wellbeing of our team members our customers and our communities remain our top priority and were continually updating our response to covid19 as the pandemic quickly evolves the spokesperson diego romero said in an email but the chains initial reaction to the texas order reflects how many grocers and retailers have been slow to take strong stands on masks for customers a worker who obtained the memo said employees at their sprouts location were told the store would rather take a fine than press the issue with a stubborn customer who refused to put on a mask i didnt think that was ok said the worker who asked to speak anonymously for fear of getting in trouble customers still come in some without masks they expect courtesy clerks to say you have to wear a mask but whos going to listen to a person on the bottom of the totem pole the worker said several customers came in without masks on a shift just this week but were still allowed to shop romero noted that the texas order provides an exemption for people with a medical condition or disability that prevents them from wearing a mask and said sprouts would not be in a position to question such an assertion from a customer the centers for disease control and prevention along with other public health experts and worker advocates have been recommending employees and customers don masks in retail settings for months the more we learn about the coronavirus the more evidence we see that face coverings can help slow its transmission by preventing people who are infected from spreading the disease through droplets but the trump administration has refused to implement a federal requirement leaving the issue to states and private corporations to figure out they should have security at every single store many grocers and retailers have held out on requiring customers to wear them as a condition of entering the store even though it could protect the health of their workers and their families there are plenty of reasons that could explain why companies are afraid to wade into a politicized issue despite the urgings of experts they dont want to escalate tensions with potentially hostile customers and they dont want to lose business to more lax competitors the united food and commercial workers a union that represents 900000 grocery workers had been urging chains to adopt mask requirements in the spring im pretty aggravated about it the unions president marc perrone told huffpost way back in april they werent telling customers or workers to wear masks while they were inside these transmission points according to the union roughly 7 in 10 members in a recent internal poll said their employers were not enforcing mask mandates at least 93 of the unions members have died of the coronavirus since march only last week did walmart the countrys largest brickandmortar retailer announce that customers would be turned away at the door if they werent wearing masks other companies like the grocer kroger and the department store kohls made similar pronouncements but even at some chains with clear mask mandates the requirements ultimately remain little more than requests cnn reported friday that walmart home depot and other retailers are still allowing maskless customers in the store despite masks being mandatory a walmart list of talking points for managers echoed the sprouts memo saying if someone refused to cover up let them continue to shop a sprouts worker in colorado said for several weeks customers were allowed to enter her store and shop without a mask despite a local ordinance that made masks a requirement earlier in the pandemic colorado did not issue a statewide mandate until this month we were told by managers that we did not need to enforce the mask policy regardless of the fact that the city i live in said everybody needed to wear a mask in public places said the worker who asked not to be named i was told by management were not the police so you dont need to say anything about it the worker said the new corporatewide requirement has been an improvement with customers being told to do curbside pickup if they wont wear a mask but enforcement often falls to cashiers and greeters whose job shouldnt involve tussling with belligerent customers she said a large man recently refused to cover his mouth with the mask that hung around his neck saying he was sick of wearing it the confrontation grew tense and she had to

that customer
environment from mother nature networks michael destries taking a page out of matt damons book for combining humor with advocacy robert redford and will ferrell have just released a very funny psa urging people to help reconnect the colorado river with the gulf of mexico in a twist both men have very different plans for making this happen whereas redfords approach is to raise the water level of the colorado via his raisetheriverorg campaign ferrell instead wants to move the ocean to where the colorado currently dries up do we really need more river ferrell ponders in front of some terrible blue screen imagery lets move it lets reconnect this thing the old fashioned way the american way the way to fix this thing is to send money so that myself and some other scientists can begin the process of moving a small portion of the ocean back toward the wet part of the river from there to there now go to movetheoceanorg and send me money things get decidedly more heated from there with hilarious jabs between the two actors the approach each man takes couldnt be more different greg stern ceo of the agency bssp that created the psa we thought that would be a good way to go beyond the expected public service announcement and get people to notice and take action on this important issue both redford and ferrell seek to restore the colorado river but ferrells move the ocean adds a layer of comedy and further engagement this is a new approach in getting people to notice and care about an important cause check it out below

worldnews kabul sept 27 reuters us defense secretary jim mattis visited kabul on wednesday to pledge support for the government of president ashraf ghani with the precarious security in the afghan capital underlined by a rocket attack on the airport hours after he touched down arriving from india where he sought support for the us administrations new south asia security plan mattis said the united states was determined not to allow a merciless enemy to kill its way to power promising a more holistic approach without fixed timetables and involving other countries in the region including pakistan he said the taliban would have to learn they could not defeat the government i want to reinforce to the taliban that the only path to peace and political legitimacy for them is through a negotiated settlement mattis told a joint news conference with ghani and nato secretary general jens stoltenberg the visit comes after us president donald trump announced a new strategy for afghanistan promising a steppedup military campaign against taliban insurgents who have gained ground as they seek to reestablish islamic law after their 2001 ouster but a rocket attack on kabul airport that injured five civilians and was claimed by both islamic state and taliban insurgents highlighted the rebels ability to strike the westernbacked government fighters holed up in a nearby building continued to resist security forces for hours a spokesman for the interior minister said mattis condemned the attack as a criminal act by terrorists adding that it was a classic definition of what the taliban are up to here now there are now about 8400 us troops in afghanistan as part of the 13500strong natoled resolute support mission advising and training afghan forces as well as a separate counterterrorism mission targeting islamic state and al qaeda as part of the new strategy which will give us commanders greater freedom to use american firepower against the taliban mattis has said the united states will send an additional 3000 troops to help train afghan security forces it will also make greater use of its air power to support afghan forces and strike the taliban a strategy that carries the risk of an increase in civilian casualties i dont want to tell the enemy exactly what we are doing but the whole point is to make certain we have a compelling battlefield advantage over anything the taliban tries to mass against your forces he said mattis said us forces would do everything humanly possible to limit civilian casualties which fueled bitter disputes between washington and the government of former president hamid karzai trump has said he expects nato allies to step up contributions of both troops and funding to the afghanistan mission and stoltenberg said the credibility of the international alliance depended on maintaining its support we know the cost of staying in afghanistan he said but the cost of leaving would be higher if nato forces leave too soon there is a risk afghanistan may return to a state of chaos and once again become a safe haven for international terrorism additional reporting by mirwais harooni and mostafa hashem in cairo editing by nick macfie
social as a child i remember heading back to school and hearing whispered rumors about the teachers in my new grade other kids and sometimes adults speaking under their breath about which teachers you wanted to get and which teachers you definitely didnt sometimes these rumors turned out to be true and sometimes they didnt my sister got one of these teachers that you definitely didnt want to get in early elementary school the rumor was that ms burkett was too strict never smiled gave out a ton of work and didnt let anyone have any fun ironically she turned out to be one of my sisters favorite teachers you see my sister was a student who even at that age usually felt underchallenged so this teachers high expectations and large workload were a perfect fit this teacher also admired my sister and gave her extra responsibilities in the classroom which created an environment where she thrived around that same time in upper elementary i got one of the teachers that everyone wanted lets call her ms green ms green was lenient creative and softspoken the rumor was that she was the fun teacher and hers the best class to be in it was one the worst school years of my early childhood her unperceptive and often sporadic discipline allowed girls to form groups and bullying to go unaddressed as a person who needed a calm emotional environment i felt miserable and unable to focus as the beginning of a new school year approaches for my children i hear the very same type of rumors about teachers that i heard in my childhood and it makes me think what makes someone a good teacher anyway of course there are bad teachers out there who hate their job are incompetent in their field or shame students into behaving but most of the time what makes someone a good or bad teacher is pretty subjective and not clearcut a study published by sandra changkredl at concordia university sorted through the most popular teacher ratings on the social media site reddit which is completely anonymous and coded them according to theme the best teachers who were more often male but maybe this has to do with the population of responders on reddit were described as engaging dedicated unique humorous easygoing physically attractive and strict but fair whereas the worst teachers who were more often female were criticized as lacking in judgement lazy unfair badtempered unattractive condescending and incompetent interestingly the personal qualities that best teachers were lauded for were often virtually identical to the behaviors that the worst teachers were criticized for for example good teachers were praised as being lenient or chill while bad teachers were chastised for putting in no effort these phrases describe the same set of characteristics in a positive way for the best teachers and a negative way for the worst the researchers say that this finding leads them to believe that who we deem to be the best teacher might just be a reflection of our or our students style personality perspective and learning needs in fact maybe there is no ideal teacher for every student since all students are unique in other words someone who i think is a great teacher you could think is a horrible teacher especially if we are people who approach learning from very different perspectives or come to the classroom with differing needs so perhaps those teachers that are considered universally great have the greatest ability to be adaptable to change their style according to the personality type characteristics and learning style of the student or students with whom they are working conversely those that are universally seen as bad teachers are unable to adapt to many types of learners and personality types because after all a great teacher is a great manager of little or sometimes not so little people according to research great managers find what is unique about each person and capitalize on it they recognize the individual abilities of each of their employees and figure out how to use these abilities to make the whole group work more effectively by isolating a persons talent great managers are able to turn that talent into performance like great managers great teachers look for what students do well praise them for that skill and figure out how to reassign revise or modify the curriculum and classroom responsibilities to capitalize on that strength a great teacher and a great manager both have to constantly revise how they are doing things in order to get the most out of those that they manage in order to do this they must get to know their students as individuals and they must also be flexible we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly

join us once again so maybe our opinion on whether or not someone is a good or bad teacher is just a reflection of how well their style and personality match up with ours as a parent or as a student but perhaps a truly great teacher is perceived as great by most students because they have the ability to recognize the style and personal strengths of each of their students and use those characteristics to propel that student towards becoming the best version of themselves a version of this article was originally published on the learning zone
health most weeks i discuss matters of heart health this week i turn the spotlight on something closer to my heart the endoflife care for my mother i offer the lessons my family learned the hard way and suggestions for anyone who is or could be facing similar challenges as families gather for the holidays perhaps some are facing difficult circumstances and this may be an opportune moment for these types of discussions when my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003 she downplayed the severity in words and deeds after undergoing a lumpectomy and radiation she returned to her regular routine only occasionally discussing her health and always indicating that all was back to normal nothing could have been farther from the truth her cancer was spreading and she knew it yet she felt it best not to trouble her children with these developments it wasnt until christmas 2010 that it became clear that her situation was worsening as my spry energetic mother for once seemed her age two weeks after spending a wonderful holiday together she became short of breath and was taken to the hospital where she fell and broke her hip as the family gathered we learned about the significance of her health challenges and during the surgery to repair her hip we learned about the additional spread of her cancer from the hospital to her transition into a rehabilitation facility my entire family including my mother understandably focused on how to improve her health so she could go home the problem however was what didnt happen we didnt seize this moment to talk about what she was facing while her doctors were our partners in talking about her rehabilitation and plans to transition back to home these outstanding medical professionals didnt discuss with us the severity of her cancer or her prognosis furthermore there was no coordinated approach among the many medical staff caring for her in the hospital the extended care facility and in her doctors offices though her last few months included moments of great joy times when reminiscing unleashed laughter masking the pain we all felt i also realize now that my family was focused on an outcome that was unlikely even now almost three years later i question my actions i still ask myself why i didnt spend more time asking her what she wanted why i didnt initiate more frank discussions with her doctors and why i didnt ask more questions when she was given chemotherapy and blood transfusions just weeks before she died significantly reducing her quality of life in her final days im also saddened by the realization that so many families endure a similar experience because few of us are prepared to navigate the many obstacles that present themselves im sharing my experiences in hopes that it will help you or someone you love should the situation arise most of all i wish for the systemic changes that will make it standard for everyone to receive the most informed compassionate care possible the right care is out there in fact the availability of services related to advanced illnesses is on the rise but you may have to work to find it the american heart association helps anyone dealing with heart disease and stroke every day we serve countless patients and caregivers providing the information and guidance to reduce their suffering and provide them with the highest quality of life possible that is why we are working to address this issue and its why we collaborate with groups like the coalition to transform advanced care ctac to work toward systematic changes that will support this type of approach to care for patients and families advanced illness is unfortunately an aspect of life while our culture no longer whispers the name of serious conditions such as cancer we far too often go silent on the subject of dealing with a disease that is likely to take the life of someone we love armed with this information i hope you will be willing to speak up when and if the time comes and insist on access to the resources and the compassion you and your family need to travel across this unfamiliar terrain with dignity this column is adapted from a speech nancy delivered at a summit for the coalition to transform advanced care she is cochair of that organizations steering committee
entertainment on daniel bouluds 50th birthday his business partner joel smilow gave him 100000 and told him to spend it wisely which he did by creating a scholarship for ccap alumni to send them to

oneplate meal that would represent their own unique style while showcasing the main ingredient and the products of the season chef daniel boulud checking on james daversos progress daverso in the

young ccap alumni daniel said i cherish being able to give the opportunity to a young chef who may not otherwise be able to have an international experience at this point early in their career i think someone as young and talented as james daverso will benefit greatly from this french culinary and cultural exchange as to why he felt daverso edged ahead of calle chef boulud said that daversos dish was really about the chicken although gabby was very creative daverso kept to the theme and executed his dish very well when james daverso was announced as the winner daniel came up with a consolation prize on the spot for gabby who also received a signed copy of daniels new book her second prize dinner for two at restaurant daniel though not quite five weeks in lyon it was nevertheless a gift from daniels heart that touched gabby deeply after announcing the winner daniel hugs gabby and tells her she has an invitation to dine at restaurant daniel regina varolli speaking with both ccap

worldnews baghdad ap hundreds of antigovernment protesters flooded the streets of iraqs capital and southern provinces on sunday defying a powerful iraqi religious leader who recently withdrew his support from the popular movement separately five katyusha rockets crashed into a river bank near the us embassy in baghdads heavily fortified green zone without causing any injuries a statement from us joint operations command said an iraqi official initially put the number of rockets at four the official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations it is the third such attack this month and the perpetrators were not immediately known security forces fired tear gas and live rounds to disperse the crowds from the capitals khilani square medical and security officials said the officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations at least 22 demonstrators were reported wounded by iraqi security forces in the first hours of sundays street rallies the mass protests started in october over widespread government corruption and a lack of public services and jobs they quickly grew into calls for sweeping changes to iraqs political system that was imposed after the 2003 us invasion iraqi security forces have responded harshly at least 500 protesters have been killed since the unrest began iraq also has been roiled by usiran tensions that threatened a regional war after an american drone strike this month killed top iranian gen qassem soleimani near baghdad the us attack pushed the shiite cleric and political leader muqtada alsadr to turn his influence toward demanding an american troop withdrawal and holding an antius rally analysts said alsadr who often mobilizes his followers on the street to buttress his political influence was using the antius protest he staged as leverage in political negotiations among iraqs elites to select the next premier alsadr has long been an unpredictable maverick in iraqi politics and is the only shiite leader who has challenged both iran and the us he also dropped his support for the antigovernment movement on friday a move that analysts said was meant to buttress his political reputation during a time of national turmoil but by sunday morning it had the opposite effect as protesters pushed back hundreds of protesters mostly students marched sunday through key squares in the capital and southern iraq to show their continued support for the antigovernment movement despite alsadrs reversal of position the demonstrations have become stronger now because of what happened said zaidoun 26 a protest organizer in baghdad many demonstrators chanted slogans against the populist preacher the movement opposes iraqs sectarian system and both us and iranian influence in iraqi affairs some protesters were worried however that the departure of alsadrs supporters and his militia members from baghdads tahrir square the hub of the protest movement could spark a renewed security crackdown alsadrs followers had been giving protesters protective cover on saturday hours after alsadrs supporters left protest sites in baghdad and some southern cities including basra security forces swooped in to clear areas of demonstrators and torch their sitin tents at least four protesters were killed in the crackdown by saturday evening however and into sunday crowds of protesters were returning to tahrir square following calls by antigovernment activists iraq after more than 100 days of protests tahrir square continues to be packed with thousands of iraqis fighting for change pictwittercomxidxzcxii4 in the beginning when he alsadr called his followers to leave we were shocked said noor a protest organizer who gave only her first name for security reasons but by the evening on saturday we breathed a sigh of relief the future for the popular movement she was quick to add was still uncertain no one knows what will happen tomorrow there will be more attacks we expect that a massive demonstration is taking place in iraq now intended as an answer to muqtada alsadrs million man march to show that iran its militias even with the tacit support of sadrists cant break the protest movement this clip is from nasiriyah pictwittercomrstolgof6f with alsadr out of the picture protesters said the only top leader on their side was grand ayatollah ali alsistani iraqs most revered shiite cleric many said they were hoping his weekly friday sermon would boost morale ahead of a major planned protest for jan 31 in a statement posted online alsadr called on the protesters to return their movement to its initial course in what many antigovernment activists interpreted as a veiled threat we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone

health sometimes the best ideas come to the person who isnt actively searching for them we spend a lot of time racking our brains in morning meetings and staring at blank computer screens waiting for an aha moment but science shows we might be better off removing ourselves entirely from our typical work environment to gain a fresh perspective earlier this year stanford university researchers found that a persons ability to think creatively increases almost 60 percent when they abandon that office chair for a stroll around the block and taking brief unplugged vacations and spending time outdoors specifically have proven to help us arrive at our best ideas and improve our decisionmaking abilities of course great creative minds dont necessarily take a cue from science or wait around for research to back up their methods they arrive through intuition and discipline at the habits and practices that lead to their best ideas and greatest successes here are 10 people who found some of their best ideas by stepping out the office away from the noise and into spaces that encourage their creativity rather than stifle it bill gates about a decade ago people were asking the former chairman of microsoft how he came up with the ideas and decisions that led to his overwhelming success and he told them think week he spent seven consecutive days in total seclusion to simply be with his thoughts no outside visitors were allowed at his quiet cottage during this time not even family members twice a year he used his time alone to read nearly 100 papers think about the future of technology and what it could mean for his company every morning before sitting down to work on his latest musical creation tchaikovsky took a short stroll around his quiet village 50 miles outside of

keeping the sheets unchanged and taking all the art off the walls famed photorealist chuck close paints every day but separates his morning and evening sessions with a routine that enhances his

wang may be a businesswoman but she is a creative designer by nature and she understands that its difficult to be truly creative in the midst of businessside demands from customer service to personnel issues to tap into her creative side wang has to put physical space between herself and these distractions which for her means designing from the comfort of her own bed we all know the sedentary nature of our workspace isnt doing us any favors so why not be productive and creative on the go that was the mindset of the late steve jobs who held walking meetings with his team as they

technology whether a social network will become popular depends upon far more than the technology its creators deploy its fate rests on who its earliest users are and how they put its features to use as many failed efforts demonstrate the success or failure of social networks also may depend on factors like speech standards and privacy policies along with the ultimate determinant whether people use them a new civic social network called brigade backed by tech billionaire sean parker is off to a good start at least measured by activity according to buzzfeed brigades users have already shared over one million views if that growth continues expect to hear politicians citing what young people say on brigade 83 percent of those using its private beta are under age 33 with that kind of competition the path to success for another fledging civic social network st paul minnesotabased civic eagle looks much steeper it will be hard to fight the network effect now boosting brigade but ceo damola ogundipe is not discouraged he believes in his mobilefirst product which includes a compelling feature a way for ordinary americans to be part of the public conversation through video debates we want the entire nation to join said ogundipe in an interview with the huffington post most of the time we have these kinds of conversations face to face at the dinner table at the water cooler and at work were not texting them or messaging them we want to bring that kind of civic discourse where its face to face where you can empathize with them to a mobile platform so far the bootstrapped startups user base is just a rounding error by modern social media standards standing at around 1600 users since the launch of its public beta and ogundipe is the only person dedicated fulltime to civic eagle although he has five cofounders and a contractor on the team but all that could change the civic eagle team has built a more interesting civic app than many ive seen demonstrated in the past few years like brigade civic eagle is focused on the discussion of political issues additionally it is personalized to each user pulling in open data from the sunlight foundation about national and state legislation related to users expressed interests say youre passionate about civil liberties the economy and foreign relations said ogundipe we filter legislative information at the federal level to you were working on the state and local level the mobile app offers a slick fast interface for browsing bills with options to favorite support or oppose them or share over facebook twitter whatsapp text messaging or email tapping on a bill sponsor brings up a picture of the legislator and contact information including social media channels the feature that makes civic eagle worth keeping an eye on however is its use of 3045 second videos the lingua franca of modern mobile media which it organizes into debates optimized for mobile users the app hosts microvideo debates as ogundipe puts it then we have ways peripherally to help people understand the legislation and policy so they can get into a more informed discussion he said users dont have to participate to watch the videos but they do have to download the app civic eagle is currently available only on the iphone although an android version is in the works like instagram there was no website at launch now civiceaglecom includes product information news and a link to download the app when i downloaded the app the thing that stuck out to me was video debates said early adopter kaylord hill a general manager at raising canes in houston none of the apps that i have or have heard of have video debate or other type of collaborative video this is a different way of arguing hill said after only a couple of weeks in public beta its unclear whether civic eagle will catch on or not this march mark zuckerberg said that at age 18 he knew that if you build something that people really like then thats enough to succeed online while its hard to disagree with a facebook founder and while even great marketing cant make up for a bad digital product marketing can certainly make a difference in adoption rates among comparable apps brigades considerable resources for marketing mean that potential competitors from civic eagle to popvoxcom may not be able to compete on paid outreach the rivals technology and communities will have to be more compelling and the people who love them will have to push them ogundipe said that he thinks his team has created a product superior to brigade i think our features are better in terms of what we built with the community he said we focus more on video not text theyre in beta so who knows what theyll end up launching hitting the video theme hard he said thats the trend were seeing whether pictures or video imagery is reigning supreme its not clear yet if a focus on mobile video is enough to differentiate civic eagle google hangouts on air hosts robust debates among up to 10 participants shared and archived on youtube snapchat is partnering with media companies and getting involved in the 2016 election facebook could add video comments any day what is clear is the importance of social networks in civic life today so its critical to pay attention to each networks specific demographics from who is overrepresented to who is underrepresented to who is not represented at all thats one reason to be cautious about politicians citing what the people say on social networks or journalists covering them as a proxy for public opinion surveys from the pew research center tell us that the demographics of social networking platforms differ significantly although facebook penetration has gone the furthest social networks are not yet statistically representative of individual cities or states women dominate pinterest google users are mostly men reddit users are mostly young men a majority of linkedin users are college graduates at present civic eagle is about 80 percent millennials mostly college graduates or college students about 60 percent of whom are africanamerican to date brigade has declined to provide demographics beyond age which platforms members of the public choose to use is tied to power class race gender political ideology and even privacy features finding the right space for the right kind of sharing isnt easy or riskfree theres a culture of fear thats put behind expressing political thought and civic expression in public said hill who studied political science in college this app gives public discourse another kind of validity you dont have to be a bigtime scholar or sit on a public council to have an opinion this makes the idea of civic engagement informal but cool despite what you may have seen in the social network sean parker never said that a billion dollars was cool in fact he told the financial times in 2011 that he thought the opposite was true but when a linkedin billionaire backs a forprofit social network like brigade to use social media to transform politics the public might understandably wonder for whom and to what end brigades stated goals are to help people feeling alone and powerless to work towards collective action around shared local and national issues that span the ideological spectrum as represented by its partner organizations its goal might also be to create a database of voter positions advocacy groups and political campaigns might find that useful as they do polling data in targeting voters who agree with their positions given enough data brigade might even be able to suggest what kinds of arguments could shift citizens positions or votes so for that matter might civic eagle its app similarly includes a platform for our leaders which elected officials and advocacy organizations can use for analytics and outreach the latter is how civil eagle generates money to date ogundipe said his company has three such customers in a private beta with a waiting list of 12 more brigade is focused on growing on college campuses this fall its not clear what other communities its targeting ceo matt mahan said brigade expects to do outreach in places where the average internet company would never target with its starting base among africanamericans civic eagle is already in one of those places whether it expands further is up to the public i think civic eagle will get picked up said hill its going to slow people down into a different conversation driving a civic message versus a comical message is a different thing i do think if and when people slow down and get out of black twitter vine instagram it will be really interesting to see
worldnews us president donald trump and qatars emir sheikh tamim bin hamad althani amidst scandals and media squabbles at home united states president donald trumps agenda in the middle east finally broke through the news cycle this summer during his widelypublicized trip to the gulf nations the famous businessman demonstrated his desire to cut some deals including some interesting and vacillating positions on the recent sanctions by other arab nations against qatar the events of that trip were highly scrutinized and alarmed some critics but despite his reputation as a wild card and at times zigzagging actions thus far trumps handling of the situation in qatar is an indicator that he may be more effective at foreign policy than hes been given credit if stability continues it may also bode well for his stature among middle eastern nations qatar is a pivotal component of the us fight against isis housing central commands regional headquarters last week two us envoys have been dispatched to qatar to deal with escalating tensions since the smallbutpowerful nation declined to comply with 13 demands made by arab neighbors including closing a turkish military base and shutting down al jazeera the situation has been mired in tough talk but relations have remained relatively neutral considering the seriousness of the threats involved as the us state department navigates its strategy things could still get ugly depending on what happens next even though trumps baitandswitch strategy has worked so far it would be wise to expect the unexpected weve already seen a number of eyebrowraising moments as the conflict surrounding qatar developed the us envoys to qatar come on the heels of an abrupt and shortlived break in diplomatic relations on june 5 saudi arabia the united arab emirates bahrain and egypt and several other arab countries announced their grievances with the emirate accusing it of supporting terrorism and trying to destabilize the situation in the region qatar was subjected to a blockade and former close allies announced the cessation of multidirectional relations in addition saudi arabia also excluded qatar from the ruled arabled coalition in riyadh tel aviv supported the antiqatar campaign israeli defense minister avigdor lieberman said that the diplomatic rift between qatar and fellow arab countries in the region opens up opportunities for cooperation in the fight against terrorism trump created a stir when despite the longstanding allied relationship between the two countries he took credit for the organized sanctions saying that qatar unfortunately has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level it is interesting that the largest arab monarchies broke off diplomatic relations with qatar shortly after trump arrived in saudi arabia on his first foreign visit in riyadh trump spoke to the leaders of the 55 muslim countries giving a speech in which he harshly criticized terrorism and the states that support it during the visit to riyadh trump also closed a 110 billion arms deal with saudi arabia the largest in history the agreement provides for the modernization of the armed forces of saudi arabia including the improvement of the air defense systems of the kingdom and the localization of the production of other types of weapons in addition the united states decided to supply air riyadh armament for 350 billion over the next 10 years after trumps very successful visit to saudi arabia unexpectedly on june 14 qatar made a deal with the united states to secure f15 fighters worth 12 billion this news surprised many who expected trump to remain in solidarity with arab sanctions against qatar after this deal the us launched into the gulf nations taking action against qatar heather nauert of the state department said now that it has been more than two weeks since the embargo started we are mystified that the gulf states have not released to the qataris nor to the public the details about the claims they are making toward qatar according to nauert the more that time goes by the more doubts are raised by the actions taken by saudi arabia and the uae at this point we are left with one simple question were the actions really about their concerns regarding qatars alleged support for terrorism or were they about the longsimmering grievances between and among the gcc gulf cooperation council countries secretary of state rex tillerson further complicated the mess a week later stating that qatar has begun its careful review and consideration of a series of requests presented by bahrain egypt saudi arabia and uae a productive next step would be for each of the countries to sit together and continue this conversation we believe our allies and partners are stronger when they are working together towards one goal which we all agree is stopping terrorism and countering extremism the united states will continue to stay in close contact with all parties and will continue to support the mediation efforts of the emir of kuwait this massive flipflop was and continues to be a very significant moment in trumps middle east policy was it intentional or a flub regardless the deal demonstrates to the countries of the region including saudi arabia that the united states is seeking to regulate the conflict and continues to regard qatar as its ally we remain committed to

bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again upon evaluation we can say that trumps visit to the persian gulf and ongoing crisis management turned out to be successful for the united states the americans received big contracts worth billions and trump sent a message that he will continue mutually beneficial relationships in the region trumps prestige increased as a result of positioning himself as a conflict mediator and he projected control of the situation by reassuring major players like saudi arabia and israel he also put qatar in check whether these victories come at a longterm cost remains to be seen although trump acted as a businessman making profitable deals he also revealed his loyalties when the allyturnedfoe allegedly supporting terrorism became a reliable partner again in just two weeks
health one of the steps arianna huffington talks about in her book thrive is to forgive yourself of all judgments of yourself and others i believe that is one of the most powerful things you can do to advance yourself to a state of wellbeing joy and enlightenment it is also one of the most difficult for most people many who feel as though theyve been hurt wronged or disappointed by others feel the need to condemn their offender eternally for the pain inflicted upon them they have no idea how someone could betray them because they had invested so much faith and trust in that person the pain of betrayal runs deep and the ability to forgive someone who has inflicted such pain feels monumental so we hold onto that pain and hurt reliving it in our minds every chance we get and discussing it with anyone who will listen over and over again what we dont realize is the more we relive the event the more energy we give it hence the more we keep it alive as we energize and continuously activate the pain we impose more stress and unnecessary harm to our physical and emotional wellbeing so how do we learn to release the pain and free ourselves of these negative emotions so we can move on with our lives for most of us its not as simple as saying im not going to think about that anymore and be done with it its natural to think about what happened and discuss it hopefully with an objective third party however in order to release it we have to ask ourselves some questions every experience negative or positive provides an opportunity to learn i believe we actually learn the most from our negative experiences if we allow ourselves to absorb the lesson so one of the first questions you should ask is how did i contribute to this experience i know its difficult to feel like you contributed at all if you feel 100percent right however you most likely played some part in it if no more than failing to set boundaries when necessary oftentimes we place too much trust in people without assessing whether or not they are worthy of our trust as a result we have expectations of them based on our values not theirs chances are your offender showed you their values many times and you ignored them because you were operating from your own set of values expecting them to do the same then when they do something overt to offend and hurt you youre shocked and terribly hurt in any personal relationship you have the power to control the extent to which you allow someone into your personal space you have the ability to set boundaries and expectations however if your expectations are based on your values then you must only allow people into your life with similar values its incumbent upon you to determine when someones values dont match your own if you choose to accept the relationship anyway then adjust your expectations accordingly failure to do so lays the groundwork for hurts and disappointments its important though not to harbor regrets when you fail to adjust your expectations to someone with different values just use that opportunity as a learning experience to understand your role this will allow forgiveness to take place so much easier remember forgiveness doesnt mean you think what that person did was okay it just means that youve learned to let go of the pain and hurt they caused and youre moving on with your life it also means youve learned a lesson from the experience and in the future become more cognizant of the behaviors youve overlooked in the past so you wont experience a repeat performance enlightenment begins where victimization ends releasing the past paves a huge path for not only your emotional health and spiritual enlightenment it also stimulates physical health forgiveness is exactly what needs to be done in order for you to grow emotionally physically and spiritually this is a major component of joyful living
health life has taught me many lessons most of which came after the death of my late husband in 2009 before his death i didnt notice my lessons i didnt tune into the greater musings of our universe ironically death taught me to be alive for perhaps the first time in my entire adult life i keep relearning many of these lessons again and again when they are thoroughly learned maybe they will stop presenting themselves and i can move on toward bigger and better lessons below im sharing with you some of my lessons and the top ten things you should consider giving up going into next year people underestimate the power of nutrition in their lives everyone is running around looking for a quick fix for their weight and minimizing the importance of proper nutrition if you just gave up processed food in 2017 not only would your weight improve but so would your health giving up processed food is not as difficult as everyone makes it out to be just eat real food lean proteins veggies fruits nuts etc in their natural state as much as possible you will see and feel the difference moving is key for your health and wellbeing flood your mind and body with positive endorphins every single day despite what many fitness professionals will tell you there is no one perfect way to move that works for everybody do what you love because that is what will stick for life the key is simple movement a body in motion stays in motion aim to sit less in 2017 and move a lot more swim walk run lift weights do yoga or go for a hike it doesnt matter what you do just keep moving when i finally hit rock bottom in 2009 with my personal weight there was one key element that made all the difference i gave up my excuses and i gave up waiting what i learned in the process is that it was so much more work to hate myself and make excuses than it ever was to do the hard work to change when i stopped putting off my health and fitness i learned it took much less time to buckle down and live fit than it ever took to procrastinate and hated myself daily stop waiting on the things you want to happen in your life we are all so busy in life but one thing ive learned is that much of my busyness is selfcreated i put so many unnecessary things on my daily schedule and that leads to being overwhelmed and being unhappy simplify in the new year remember that no is an acceptable answer and cut the busyness change your priorities and put the critical stuff at the top like your health and fitness your family your interpersonal relationships and your happiness dont be busy with things that dont improve your life we all have regret in this life but if we focus on what could have happened or what we should have done then we cant find joy in where we are dont live your life with the shouldve and couldve because you cant go back and change the past make peace with each day and pat yourself on the back for all you accomplished living with regret is useless and a waste of your present moment do your best each day improve where you can when you can and then give up the feelings of guilt and inadequacies im a people pleaser by nature but ive learned that there is no way i can make everyone happy not everyone is going to agree with me not everyone is going to like me thats okay my personal motto is to be a good person do the right thing but also do what makes me happy own your life and learn that pleasing everyone is just not realistic we all have fears in this life but when we let fear rule our lives we limit our full potential give up the fears that take your energy and remember you shouldnt stress what you cant control my loss taught me to let go of many fears and its also taught me to live my dreams despite the things that scare me because life is short and we should live it nature is a healer but we tend to spend so much time indoors we forget that feeling better can be as simple as stepping outside this year aim to head outside and take in the fresh air the beautiful views and the healing power of nature combine your daily movement with your time outside for a double benefit and leave the electronics at home you will find that the time in nature will allow you to hear your inner voice if you dont drown it out with artificial noise while you outside try deep breathing several times for full body cleansing the weight of stuff takes so much joy out of our lives and makes us feel heavy declutter in 2017 and find your comfort in having less when your joy comes from purchasing stuff you will find that you are never truly satisfied your brain gets the immediate stimulus of a new object that fades quickly you are consistently trying to up the ante and keep that stimulus going instead find joy in giving to others purging your life of clutter and spending time improving your life through fitness nutrition and selfgrowth social media has helped our society in many regards but it has also hurt our collective communities we are consistently comparing our lives with the lives of others remember that people only put their highlights on social media you arent getting the full story im here to tell you no matter what you read on social media nobody has a perfect life everyone has difficulties everyone has problems everyone has pain just these simple changes can lead to a fantastic and healthy 2017
environment by lawrence hurley and valerie volcovici washington nov 24 reuters the us governments authority to regulate air pollution nationwide often against the wishes of republicanleaning states could face new curbs when the us supreme court takes on two highstakes cases in coming months the cases focus on the broadranging power wielded by the us environmental protection agency epa under the landmark clean air act first enacted in 1970 the law was envisioned as a cooperative effort between the federal government and states in which the epa sets standards but states have to set plans to comply that flexibility has allowed states which favor looser regulations like texas and kansas to resist with the support of industry groups like the us chamber of commerce and the national association of manufacturers when the agency wants to impose more stringent standards in both cases before the conservativeleaning supreme court mainly republicanled states and industry groups have challenged different epa regulations in the hope of weakening the agencys authority the epa has support from democraticleaning states like massachusetts and new york and from environmental groups it would be both a big deal and somewhat unsurprising if epa loses both clean air act cases said richard frank an environmental law professor at the university of california at davis school of law such rulings would reflect a dilution of the deference that courts generally show government agencies in interpreting statutes he added the cases do not challenge whether the epa can regulate pollutants such as greenhouse gases but instead how it uses the clean air act to regulate a wide range of them the epas authority to interpret the statute broadly is vital to its mission in the face of resistance from republicans and a handful of democrats in congress and some state governments in the climate change context in particular the clean air act is the epas main tool for tackling greenhouse gas emissions after the us senate rejected a capandtrade bill in 2010 the supreme court rulings are unlikely to have a direct impact on president barack obamas sweeping climate action plan which was unveiled in june legal experts say in part because the epa will be using its authority under parts of the law not at issue in the cases but decisions against the epa could pose obstacles to the way it rolls out its rules in the first case to be argued on dec 10 the nine justices will consider the legality of a rule that regulates air pollution that crosses state lines the second case expected to be scheduled for oral argument in february concerns a challenge to the obama administrations first wave of regulations targeting heattrapping greenhouse gases the court is due to issue rulings in both cases by the end of june the epas crossstate air pollution rule meant to take effect in january 2012 would have set limits on nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from coalfired power plants in 28 states that emit pollutants in the eastern part of the country that directly affect air quality in other states generally referred to as upwind states an alliance of industry groups and 15 states in addition to companies like southern co peabody energy corp and american electric power inc challenged the rule and it was never implemented the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit determined in august 2012 that the rule was invalid on multiple grounds under the worstcase scenario for the government the supreme court could weaken the epas power to bring recalcitrant states into line legal experts said in the obama administrations petition asking for supreme court review of the crossstate rule solicitor general donald verrilli said that if the dc circuit decision stood it would gravely undermine enforcement of the clean air act delaying the ability of downwind states to comply with air standards and making it nearly impossible for those states to meet deadlines a ruling against the epa could also encourage states to resist other epa proposals if the supreme court pushes back against the epa and says the epa has to give the states the first chance to address the problem that gives the states more leverage said jonathan martel a partner at law firm arnold porter llp who represents business interests in air pollution cases in the climate change case the supreme court agreed last month to consider a single question of the many raised by nine different coalitions of industry groups such as the american petroleum institute and 16 states including texas and virginia they appealed a june 2012 ruling by the appeals court in washington upholding the first suite of epa rules aimed at tackling climate change the justices will weigh only whether the agency has authority to regulate greenhouse gases under a permitting program for stationary sources of pollution a loss for the epa could remove a whole category of pollutants not just greenhouse gases from the socalled prevention of serious deterioration or psd program which requires any new or modified major polluting facility to obtain a permit before any new construction is done if it emits any air pollutant under the program the operators have to show that they are using the best available technology available to reduce emissions of the covered pollutants it may not be all bad news for the epa the court passed up a chance to review the agencys determination that greenhouse gases the driving force behind climate change are a pollutant that needs to be regulated under the clean air act wins for the epa in both cases would not however lead to any major shift in the law in its favor experts say we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased

science an invisible cloud of gas is speeding toward our milky way galaxy at 700000 miles per hour but dont worry it will take about 30 million years to get here its a case of what goes up must come down according to hubble space telescope astronomers who say the space cloud likely originated in our galaxy and is boomeranging back when it returns they predict a spectacular burst of star formation perhaps providing enough gas to make 2 million suns astronomers are aware of many space clouds but the smith cloud is unique because its trajectory is wellknown the cloud is an example of how the galaxy is changing with time said andrew fox of the space telescope science institute in baltimore maryland its telling us that the milky way is a bubbling very active place where gas can be thrown out of one part of the disk and then return back down into another doctoral astronomy student gail smith discovered the smith cloud in the 1960s researchers believe it is 11000 lightyears long and 2500 lightyears across fox and his team recently used the hubble space telescope to learn about the clouds chemical composition and origin the astronomers found that the smith cloud is as rich in sulfur as the milky ways outer disk a region about 40000 lightyears from the galaxys center about 15000 lightyears farther out than our sun and solar system this means that the smith cloud was enriched by material from stars this would not happen if it were pristine hydrogen from outside the galaxy or if it were the remnant of a failed galaxy devoid of stars instead the cloud appears to have been ejected from within the milky way and is now boomeranging back how the space cloud was catapulted from the milky way in the first place and what has kept it together remain unknown only more research will tell the astronomers findings appear in this months edition of the astrophysical journal letters
social when public schools first started popping up in the us they were considered secondary to other handson pursuits learning to read write and perform basic arithmetic in classrooms was not equal to or greater than the actual work of building the nation and keeping up family farms even when a basic public school education became a relative priority the school calendar revolved around agriculture a necessity of the american way of life three months off in the summer months was not mandated because students needed down time or free creative play or time to decompress from the pressures of their studies those months off were full of even more work and little free time and plenty of hard work for the sake of the family and the nation though family farms as a whole have become an antiquated piece of american history the idea of summers off from school is still alive and well the american enterprise institute for public policy research finds that the average american student receives 13 weeks off of school each calendar year with 10 or 11 of those coming consecutively during june july and august approximately while barely any other countries have more than seven weeks off in a school calendar around 10 percent of us schools have transitioned to a yearround school calendar with shorter breaks inserted throughout the year but the majority of schools in the us still follow a summersoff schedule but why there is no perilous economic reason that keeping children in school during the summer would be detrimental and there is no medical reason that three consecutive months during the center of the calendar year are necessary for the healthy development of children the reason the school year remains in a summersoff state is simple it is easier than changing it that mentality begins with teachers in the classroom and escalates to educational policymakers changing the ways things have always been even if there is some pretty solid evidence that it would improve things is too cumbersome so why bother why teachers dont want yearround schooling one of the first issues educators raise when the idea of yearround schooling arises is getting rid of summers off theoretically if nothing about the school calendar changed except the timing of the days off teachers and administrators would still have the same amount of time off but it would be spread out over 12 months more evenly most educators will admit that they enjoy having at least three consecutive months each year to themselves without the demands of being around children for seven hours every day and spending their evenings deep in grading or lesson planning many teachers take advantage of the time off to seek out other avenues of employment to supplement their annual incomes its doubtful that these teachers would be able to find the same level of employment during one or two week breaks scattered throughout the year and its hard to say if those shorter spurts would allow enough time to for the mental decompression teachers need to perform their important jobs to the best of their abilities i believe that the benefit to teachers of yearround schooling would far outweigh these inconveniences though the pressure to have highperforming students is the bane of every teachers existence and research shows that too much time off from the school routine can actually undo the hard work teachers put in to their students in fact many teachers report that the first two to three months of each school year are spent teaching remedial skills from the previous grade wasting even more of the time that should go into original learning what do you say teachers are your misgivings about yearround school based on personal reasons or out of concern for your students
science look both ways before you cross the street that lifesaving precaution was drilled into us as children and apparently chimpanzees have picked it up too the video above shows four chimps navigating a highway in uganda watch as a timid youngster swivels his head from left to right and then left again all while the groups alpha male waits patiently for him to catch up the firstofitskind video was made as part of a survey conducted between 2012 and 2014 in the sebitoli area of ugandas kibale national park to assess how chimps adapt to new roads researchers observed 122 chimps cross the highway where cars routinely pass at speeds of up to 60 mph the researchers noticed that the animals looked left and right 90 percent of the time while making their way weve described chimpanzee behavior facing a dangerous situation never described before marie cibot a doctoral student in primatology at the national museum of natural history in paris and the studys lead researcher told new scientist the new study adds to a growing body of research that shows our closest living relatives arent nearly as different from us as we once imagined studies have shown that chimps throw temper tantrums have distinct cultures and even do puzzles for fun and their shortterm memory may be even better than ours the study was published online april 10 in the american journal of primatology
social it took betsy devos nearly a year to take any action on the nearly 100000 applications by former students who assert that they were deceived and abused by predatory forprofit colleges like corinthian itt and kaplan but the new process announced today appears to be a step backwards a new attack on students and a gift to the most abusive predatory schools in addition to denying thousands of claims today devos outlined new standards that rip off injured students by limiting their debt relief through weighing of their income often even if they have only a lowwage parttime job and even if that job has nothing to do with the training they received at the offending college its somewhat unclear from department statements and media reports exactly how the comparisons will be made but it appears the new approach would punish those students who have overcome the obstacles of a deceptive subpar education and found a way to support themselves or it could penalize the financially worstoff graduates of a career education program at a failed school if others in that program did better worse to limit student debt relief the department is using income data derived from the obama gainful employment rule the same data that the department at the urging of forprofit college lobbyists appears ready to abandon when measuring the performance of schools in other words data that shows career college students tend to earn low incomes is used by devos when it helps her limit debt relief for students but is trashed by devos when it puts at risk the profits of predatory forprofit colleges but what the department has announced is even worse than that because 1 even full cancellation of federal loans would not come close to making students whole from their experience of attending a dishonest school because of all the outofpocket expenditures grants scholarships earned benefits expensive private loans time and effort that the student expended and that would not be recovered in light of those nonrecoverable costs for students the new stingy standard is even more harsh 2 the relief standards are not nearly high enough to deter bad colleges from staying in the federal student aid program and more importantly theyre not high enough to deter the department from keeping bad colleges in the program thus the new devos policy of limiting loan relief for defrauded students is in fact a permissive approach to waste fraud and abuse that will over the long term not save taxpayers money but instead will cost billions students have rightly taken action today to file a class action lawsuit against devos for denying them the relief to which they are fully entitled devos was supposed to make her first appearance as secretary today before the house education and the workforce committee but that appearance her only scheduled appearance before the committee for 2017 was inexplicably cancelled the committee chairwoman virginia foxx a relentless supporter of the forprofit college industry claims as her committee motto keeping washington accountable hardly
entertainment cream puff cake is layers and layers of pure magic chocolate and vanilla pudding cream oh my cream puffs just dont get enough attention who makes them no one that i know i have literally never gone to someones house and been offered a cream puff its just not a thing that happens honestly its one of lifes great injustices lack of cream puffs sad i think one of the most common misconceptions about cream puffs is that they are difficult they absolutely arent the dough called choux sounds awfully fancy but thats just a front its a trick by the french to make us feel unsophisticated and inferior im sure of it in reality choux is just a very thick roux with eggs beaten in what im saying is if you can make homemade gravy you can make cream puff dough and any southern girl worth her salt can bs her way to an amazing cream gravy its just a gift we have of course there are a few things to keep in mind anything with a silent x in the name is bound to be a bit finicky but its nothing we cant handle first off choux humidity sticky mess im not a scientist so i cant tell you why its just how it is personally i think its the devils work because we all know that rainy days stuck inside is when you need cream puffs the most the other thing make the dough as close to serving time as possible same day is great next day not so much the dough puffs up and becomes hollow inside with a crisp chewy exterior but tack 24 hours onto that and things arent pretty its a sad soggy sight that you should never expose yourself to lastly dont fill until its close to time for serving filling makes the dough soggy soggy sad you see where this is headed so make your dough on a dry day and serve the same day fill just before serving easy peasy i think so this dough comes together in minutes and bakes up quickly it truly is a wonderfully impressive last minute dessert and served as a layer cake instead of individual cream puffs is an spectacular time saver not to mention so lovely looking

science an 1800yearold stone carving of what may be the head of a roman god was recently found in an ancient garbage dump british archaeologists announced today july 3 an undergraduate student at durham university discovered the largely intact head during an archaeological dig at the binchester roman fort a major roman empire fort built around ad 100 in northeastern englands county durham archaeologists involved in the dig believe that somebody probably tossed the 8inchlong 20 centimeters statue in the garbage when the building was abandoned in the fourth century during the fall of the roman empire see photos of the stone head dig site the team is still not certain who the carved head is meant to represent though they have noted its resemblance to a similar stone head discovered in 1862 inscribed with the name antenociticus a celtic deity associated with military prayers in that particular region a shrine sits nearby the garbage dump further suggesting the stone head was involved in prayer and represents a deity it is probably the head of a roman god we cant be sure of his name but it does have similarities to head of antenociticus david petts a durham university archaeologist who was involved in the dig said in a statement we may never know the true identity of this new head but we are continuing to explore the building from which it came to help us improve our understanding of late roman life at binchester and the roman empires northern frontier in northern england the team is particularly interested in the unique local aesthetic of the head which combines classical roman art and regional romanobritish art some of the facial features also appear to be african though this remains speculative this is something we need to consider deeply petts said in a statement if it is an image of an african it could be extremely important although this identification is not certain the dig was conducted in collaboration with stanford university in an effort to unearth evidence from the era leading up to the fall of the roman empire the team has yet to publish a report on their recent findings in a peerreviewed scientific journal follow laura poppick on twitter follow us livescience facebook google original article on livesciencecom we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again
environment an antifracking group in colorado has released a series of ads blasting claims made by the oil and gas industry in the state as four communities prepare to vote on bans or moratoriums on drilling and fracking in their regions fort collins broomfield and boulder voters all face ballot initiatives that would put a moratorium on fracking and drilling inside city limits for five years lafayette voters will consider a measure that if passed would amend the city charter with a community bill of rights one that would make it illegal for any person or company to drill for oil and gas within the city limits released by frack free colorado and called frack check the videos offer counterpoints to the industrys drilling safety claims in one video watch above weston wilson an epa whistleblower who worked at the environmental protection agency for 37 years talks about the threat of groundwater contamination due to fracking he cites a leaked epa powerpoint slideshow from august one that wilson says reveals a clear link between fracking and groundwater contamination in pennsylvania the presentation concludes that the methane and other gasses released during drilling caused significant damage to the water quality there wilson says in the video charges from that leaked document shows that wells being fracked for gas create pathways that allow gas to migrate to shallow aquifers wilson also points to a duke university study that found drinking water wells near fracking sites have 17times more methane than those wells that are farther away this epa report backs up other studies like the one done by duke university that found drinking water wells near fracking sites have 17 times more methane than those wells that are farther away its now clear that epa had prior knowledge that fracking does cause contamination of groundwater and contaminate the air we breathe wilson concludes in the second video below anthony ingraffea a professor of civil and environmental engineering at cornell university who has also served as a oil and gas industry consultant for more than 25 years talks about how much fracking has changed over the years story continues below video the gas industry is going to tell anybody who is going to listen that fracking has been around since 1947 ingraffea says in the video saying that fracking has been around since 1947 and shouldnt be of concern now is pretty misleading fracking has changed tremendously in the last 65 years as have many industries for instance in 1947 a frack job would consist of about 1000 gallons of water or napalm going into a single well today fracking for shale gas or shale oil can involve 10 or more wells on one pad and collectively consuming over 50 million gallons of water and chemicals hydraulic fracturing is a controversial process of injecting water sand and chemicals underground at very high pressures to release natural gas most companies however have declined to reveal what components make up their fracking fluids calling them trade secrets it has been less than a year since gov john hickenlooper said that the state would sue any city in colorado that bans fracking and only a few months since the state filed its first lawsuit against longmonts drilling rules the push in the four communities follows a surge in drilling around the state which has become home to a total of more than 51000 operating oil and gas drill sites a recent report from advocacy group environment america reported that colorado is the secondhighest fracked state in the us with 18168 fracking wells second only to texas colorado has been called the ground zero of fracking ana tinsly spokesperson for frack free colorado said in a press statement gas and oil companies are virtually selfregulated with devastating consequences as we saw in the recent flooding of thousands of fracking sites that were allowed to be built on a flood zone governor hickenlooper in fact is such a

around the table almost rituallike in a funny way hickenlooper said the washington times reported last year when hickenlooper was invited to give the keynote address at the atlantics next generation energy forum he vigorously defended the practice and even went so far as to say that the anxiety about fracking isnt directly connected to the facts theres a lot of anxiety out there certainly with hydraulic fracturing and the kind of unorthodox technologies for the extraction of natural gas but oftentimes that anxiety isnt directly connected to facts hickenlooper said during the forum

politics a judge has declined to block a section of a georgia election law that bans handing out food and water to voters waiting in line the provision is part of a sweeping elections overhaul passed by georgia lawmakers last year voting rights groups who have filed a lawsuit challenging multiple parts of the law argued that the provision infringes their free speech rights and should be immediately blocked while the case is pending the 74page order which was issued thursday means that the provision will remain in effect for the closely watched november general election republican gov brian kemp is locked in a rematch with democratic challenger stacey abrams while democratic us sen raphael warnock is trying to fend off a challenge from republican herschel walker the state had argued that the provision was necessary to protect against conditions at polling places that could raise worries over potential illegal campaigning or vote buying state lawyers also argued it was too close to the upcoming election to make changes us district judge jp boulee said the voting rights groups may ultimately prevail on part of their challenge but he agreed with the state that its too close to the election to block any part of the provision he noted that requiring different rules for the general election than those in place for the primaries earlier this year could cause confusion for election workers boulee said that voting rights groups had failed to show that prohibiting the distribution of food and drinks within 150 feet 45 meters of a polling place violates their constitutional rights but he said that another part of the provision that bars people from offering food and drink within 25 feet 76 meters of any person in line is probably unconstitutional because that zone is tied to the location of voters and could stretch thousands of feet from the polling place the voting rights groups expressed disappointment with boulees ruling but said they will continue to fight while georgias cruel ban on line relief stands for now we look forward to presenting our broader case against sb 202 at trial where we will prove that many provisions in the legislation violate federal law and the constitution said aclu of georgia voting rights attorney rahul garabadu republicans have said high turnout and short lines in this years primary elections show that the new law doesnt discourage or restrict voting but critics say it disproportionately affects marginalized voters and many democrats have pledged to roll it back we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again the us justice department has also filed a lawsuit alleging that the 98page georgia voting law is racially discriminatory but it was not part of the request to immediately block the food and water provision

social failure seems to be all the rage these days fail fast fail smart fail forward its hard not to gag on the plethora of failure cliches that headline cultural media today my 6yearold daughter is even wrapped up in the topic one day reflecting on the fact that she will receive grades for the first time next year she asked me mamma did you ever get an f she was being completely literal in her definition of failure she was not being poetic or ironic or asking if i had failed in any metaphysical way she was asking if i had ever received an f as a grade in school somehow in this context failure didnt seem so great i very glaringly received an f and i was embarrassed for it it happened in my senior year of high school while i was in the running for valedictorian i had become overly confident everyones favorite euphemism for arrogant and stopped showing up for my calculus class of course i promptly and legitimately failed the next test with a score of only 56100 yes i remember the exact score more than 20 years later for me the f was an embarrassment but it was not identitychanging it was for an 18yearold a much needed kick in the pants but my daughters question caused me to wonder what is the impact of failure on kids more broadly for my daughter and others her age how would failing a test impact her selfesteem and motivation to truly understand how failure affects motivation i first needed to explore and define the term fail an f in school is a very different experience than a tinderfail but they both use the same turn of phrase dictionarycom gave me some interesting insight while it has seven different definitions of the word fail these in particular caught my eye die away how did the definitions move so quickly away from failure being an outcome to failure being an identity no wonder my daughter was wondering if id ever received an f and along with these definitions i also learned that for most students and i imagine also for most adults their number one fear is failing in front of their peers the ridicule that can come from failing in front of ones classmates can be devastating and not necessarily beneficial making sure actions have constructive consequences so maybe we remove the f altogether lord knows schools as renowned as harvard have basically done just that reporting that the median grade for its students is a and an a is the most frequently awarded grade maybe harvard knows something about the lifeconsequences of receiving an f in school that we dont but i believe gradeinflation is not the solution nor is the solution as simple as that psychology today agrees suggesting that if we dont allow students to fail in the classroom we are setting them up for failure in the real world actions need to have consequences and sometimes those consequences are not trophies and gold stars so how to do we keep failure as a consequence emphasizing the importance of accountability but reduce the fear how do we make sure consequences are constructive and not identitychanging digital games presenting failure as an outcome not an identity in considering these questions i couldnt help but observe that my daughters failure in a digital game was nowhere near as daunting to her as failing in a classroom within a video game she isnt demotivated each time she loses she simply wants to play again research from the university of washington in seattle concurs citing that a computer game keeps people playing the game even in the presence of failure in fact digital games are built around the concept that progress occurs through experimentation failure and adaptation to me there seem to be several motivational aspects of digital games that keep accountability high and fear of failure low at the ed tech company where i work istation we spend a lot of time ensuring that students know exactly how they are doing in key cognitive areas this way when or if they fail they do so knowingly but privately and certainly without ridicule and there is always an opportunity to try again were not alone in recognizing this 70 percent of k12 teachers agree that using digital games increases motivation and engagement in fact a teacher recently remarked to me that some of her shyest students see the greatest gains in a digital environment like istation because even when they hesitate to take risks in class they may readily take risks in a computerbased gamelike environment which is a more private experience digital games are far from a complete solution and the world will always need great teachers willing to support but not coddle students like my high school calculus teacher mr paula but gamelike education technology can provide students with good lessons in how to embrace accountability maintain high levels of motivation take risks and avert fear we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your

social the university of wisconsinsuperior became the latest college to try out an education fad while slashing their budget with such a highprofile notice its clear their administrators were looking to get credit for starting a national trend which might catch on in the south yet in the end its the students who lose out when universities like this school loses sight of what their mission while hundreds of millions of state dollars are spent on pro sports in the state in the chronicle of higher education article plan to phase out 2 dozen programs stuns faculty at wisconsinsuperior by katherine managan the administration announced they would suspend more than two dozen programs at their college ranging from the arts theater to the sciences chemistry forensic earth science physics social science political science geography sociology and a variety of fields that would produce teachers in science psychology and computer science the administrators announced that the moves had nothing to do with cutting costs the school faces a 25 million deficit but it was designed to make it easier for students to graduate on time students tend to get overwhelmed by too many course offerings university administrators said as a result they added students often make bad decisions that cause them to take too many credits its hard to imagine a history major getting distracted by a health and human performance class similarly suspended or a business student accidently taking a legal studies course also suspended if such students are so apt to be distracted then there needs to be an improvement in teaching and advising moreover what are the students going to do when they try and conduct a real world job search there are so many positions and choices the university chancellor tried to defend the decision claiming it would only affect a few students when we look at the percentage of students who were majoring in the suspended departments it was around 3 percent well if the mission was to help students graduate on time why did they get rid of something that didnt even affect 97 of students i would offer courses in logic at uws and make them mandatory for those administrators the uws chancellor and vicechancellor insisted that they made their choices after involving faculty in the decisionmaking process the truth of the matter is that faculty were consulted and made other recommendations which were evidently ignored since they did not call for shutting down any majors ethics might be another course to start offering at uws the school will allow students to finish their declared major and minors but wont allow any student into the suspended programs according to mangan so much for academic freedom whats crazier still is that no faculty members will be fired those whose programs are to be suspended can still show up to work but wont have any students to teach in the article sources revealed that the university is hoping that the professors will leave on their own without any students to teach my students didnt believe this story and researched it for themselves they cant believe a college would do that if you want a good idea youre more likely to find it from a wisconsin student if the school wished to help us graduate on time they should hire more advisors to help students said a history and political science major in the che article students make bad choices from a lack of good advice not because geethere are just so many classes out there but uws seems blinded by rushing to the latest fad guided pathways from groups like complete college america where the plan is to rush students through the process so they dont take any more time in school than they absolutely have to we remain committed to providing you with the

when they do graduate learning how to write how to do math how to present how to use critical thinking skills which is what future employers want not someone who rushed the process so an administrator

politics it was a sweltering arizona evening in late june and kari lake was standing on a stage in a church community center in front of a giant poster of kari lake the promotional material for lakes campaign for governor featured lakes head and shoulders floating alongside donald trumps head and shoulders with a quote from trump kari lake is fantastic she is going to win big trumps endorsee was about to be interviewed by a reporter for a japanese tv station in gold canyon an upscale phoenix suburb at the base of a mountain lakes own video team hovered in the background capturing her every move it was a million degrees and lake was dry as a cactus it wasnt long into the interview that lake turned to two of her favorite subjects trump and the media people of this country love donald trump lake said its the corrupt rotten media thats been trying to tell them and brainwash them into believing that people dont like him lakes remarks about a corrupt and rotten media are especially breathtaking considering the source a former newscaster who less than two years ago was still delivering the news in one of the nations largest media markets i want you to know if the arizona repugnant as ive taken to calling it lakes derisive nickname for the arizona republic newspaper if cnn and msnbc are attacking people those are the people you want to vote for lake told the crowd at a candidate forum just prior to her interview with the japanese station how lake came to leave the media or at least the story she tells about why she left the media is the foundational story of her outsider campaign for governor it also mirrors the trajectory of the far rights accelerating break with reality during the covid pandemic and in the aftermath of the 2020 election a rupture driven by actual fake news and propaganda lake whose previous job involved discerning fact from fiction is now closely aligned with the cowboyhatsporting state lawmaker mark finchem a trumpbacked promoter of election falsehoods running for the role of chief elections officer together they help form the ranks of candidates who claim the 2020 election was corrupt and stolen and both recently suggested without credible evidence that 2022s results may be compromised too lake has also been endorsed by a slate of extremist figures tied to trump including former national security adviser michael flynn us rep paul gosar ariz mypillow ceo mike lindell and arizona state sen wendy rogers the fringes of the fringe earlier this year lake was featured in promotional materials for the america first political action conference the extremist gathering organized by 23yearold white nationalist nick fuentes lake responded that she was not taking part in the event and called it a false photo fuentes followers turned on lake but fuentes defended her there was a scheduling mixup with kari lake just a misunderstanding take it easy on her we support her he posted on telegram after the dustup theres at least one commonly agreedupon reality in this race lake is resonating with the gop base with two weeks to go until the aug 2 primary lake has consistently led in polling of the gop field although more recent polling suggests the race tightened after doug ducey arizonas moderate termlimited republican governor who also leads the national fundraising campaign for gop governors endorsed her main rival developer karrin taylor robson a move that fanned the flames of duceys proxy war with trump on monday former vice president mike pence also threw his support behind the more establishmentfriendly taylor robson shes a diva of her own persona the television news personality who just doesnt believe the news if lake wins the republican nomination she will likely face democratic secretary of state katie hobbs in a general election that republicans are signaling they may use to relitigate for the umpteenth time the 2020 election results in a state that became known for its widely discredited election audit in a debate this month lake pushed the stolen election narrative as a litmus test for the gop field in april she and finchem sued state and county officials to try and ban the use of electronic voting machines in this years election its election denier against election defender said chuck coughlin a veteran gop strategist in arizona framing the hypothetical matchup between lake and hobbs lake 52 is a charismatic madefortv candidate entirely in trumps mold if trump happened to be a woman with high cheekbones and a pixie haircut like trump lake has spent decades on tv unlike the former president lake was primarily a local news anchor spending a majority of her career at foxs phoenix station lake even interviewed trump twice before following him down the golden escalator combative hardright maga warrior is a new look for lake and as a necessary feature of that image lake has turned against the reporters who were once her colleagues its a vitriolic relationship with the media she wont talk to anybody without it being on her terms said coughlin shes a diva of her own persona the television news personality who just doesnt believe the news lakes remarks about her former profession make you wonder how she stuck it out for as long as she did lake has called the media criminal and said that some journalists probably should be locked up after leaving her job at fox in march of last year lake launched her campaign for governor three months later by bashing a set of tvs and declaring its time to take a sledgehammer to the mainstream medias lies and propaganda lake now likes to turn the tables on her former industry colleagues last month lakes video team captured and edited a clip of her declining an interview with a cnn reporter outside of an event the clip went viral and the reporters face during the interaction became a meme on the right lakes campaign suggested to me a day earlier that lake actually had plans to sit down with the network but the campaign is known for baiting reporters then packaging the resulting cringe into viral clips lakes everpresent video team is led by her husband jeff halperin who owns a video production company lakes teenage daughter is also paid to consult on her campaign the arizona republic reported huffpost sent lake a detailed request for factchecking and comments for this piece but lakes campaign declined to provide answers to any specific questions it is very obvious that huffpost is gearing up for a smear piece your line of questioning has zero truth behind it dr evils washington post tried the same type of smear and it backfired do you leftist rags not realize that voters see this and laugh at you why wont you write about karis policies her homeless policy her border policy her education policy the response continued you exist solely as a propaganda mill for the left and no one is buying your bs run your trash story the people of arizona know kari lake look sic forward to electing her governor in arizona lake agreed to a 10minute interview with huffpost on the implied condition that her campaign be allowed to record it positioning us squarely in lakes wheelhouse lake and i sat stiffly facing each other on a bench outside the church building in gold canyon asked if there was a specific moment when it became clear to her she could no longer be a journalist lake went back to the start of the pandemic ive always seen that modernday journalism in america has really pushed to the left obviously but i felt that i was a voice of reason in the newsroom lake told me at the same time that she seemed to be fishing for an opening to meme me really during covid is when i went what is going on here things werent making sense watching them now lakes two maga rallyadjacent interviews with trump dont give any inkling of what was ahead except when in early 2020 trump seems to override his handlers to give lake extra time to ask him questions lake also interviewed president barack obama in 2016 but at work and online lake was gaining a reputation for amplifying conspiracy theories that would touch on the election and the coronavirus lake was also promoting her presence on farright social media sites like the nowdefunct parler and gab a platform favored by antisemites lakes connection to a factbased world became even more tenuous when she began running for office she has since been linked to ron watkins the rumored leader of the qanon movement which believes the nations elites are running a secret child sex trafficking ring the man alleged to be q himself watkins has strongly denied being the voice behind qs writings but has admitted his general involvement in the qanon movement is also running for office as a republican in democrat tom ohallerans eastern arizona congressional district watkins posted a photo on telegram last year claiming he had dinner with lake lakes campaign didnt respond to a request for comment about her relationship with watkins or nick fuentes the events of recent years provide a striking contrast to how lake describes her younger self to audiences as a 24yearold rising tv anchor lake drove her packed latemodel used car from iowa to arizona to pursue a career in journalism leaving behind a family with seven sisters and a brother lake told huffpost she got into journalism because she loves telling peoples stories i like being in the middle of whats happening and it really was a wonderful career for most of the time but it just got to the point where it was becoming propaganda and when i realized that i had to get out scott jones a former tv news director who runs ftvlive a gossip blog covering the cable news industry said lake was certainly big and wellliked in phoenix and for a long time while she was doing the job she was a real journalist and then slowly this change happened where she became infected with the radical rightwing disease that change unfolded publicly over the latter half of trumps presidency according to people in lakes personal and professional orbit whove followed her career in 2018 while lake was still at fox she tweeted that a grassroots movement to raise teacher pay was actually cover for a ploy to legalize pot lake later deleted the tweet and apologized another time lake was caught on a hot mic ridiculing the phoenix new times calling the citys spunky altweekly a rag for selling marijuana after they reported on her joining parler lake was starting to make these statements usually on twitter or somewhere on social media she would get in trouble and go off the air for a little while fox would never say if they suspended her or not jones said theyre embarrassed by the mud she splashed on the station and theyre mad with management who let her continue to get away with it especially late in her career lakes station wouldnt elaborate on her tenure there beyond confirming her final day of employment on march 1 2021 lakes campaign also wouldnt comment on her extended breaks or the specifics of her departure while lake was taking family medical leave from her job in early 2021 jones reported that she was spotted at the conservative political action conference in florida which lake attended this year as a featured speaker lake announced her resignation from fox 10 not long after lake left the station with people completely embarrassed by her jones said theyre embarrassed by the mud she splashed on the station and theyre mad with management who let her continue to get away with it especially late in her career diana pike a former hr director for fox who was one of lakes supervisors for 20 years said lake generally had good performance reviews and doesnt ever recall her being formally reprimanded but lakes wielding of social media to share her opinions eventually became a headache for her managers thats where 2018 and 2019 start to become real hot for her with regards to her posting information on parler we had to talk to her and say you cant say this you cant say any of this stuff said pike who retired from the station in 2019 pike said lake was told she couldnt represent fox with radical comments another former station employee said lake was really good in a supportive role with her former coanchor i dont have any ill will toward her or any negative feelings about her personally all i can say is that im perplexed like a lot of people why she turned into this mean girl shes like a mean girl in middle school lakes long career allowed her to enter politics with a recognizable name and brand although a number of republicans at gop events questioned lakes conservative credentials borrowing liberally from her personal reserves to fund her campaign taylor robson has run several ads underscoring for voters that lake was a registered democrat from 2008 to 2012 lake also gave money to barack obama and john kerry under her married name contributions she described to local media outlets as being on behalf of her family but more were won over by lakes disavowal of a corporate media industry thats viewed on the right with intense skepticism if not outright scorn ive always liked kari and ive always liked what she has to say because shes articulate and she understands the business of the media all we want is the truth and we dont feel like were getting the truth said gold canyon gop cochairman pam burks who was impressed with lake and introduced her to the group as a symbol of truth in journalism ive always liked kari and ive always liked what she has to say because shes articulate and she understands the business of the media said kevin brislawn a retired 70yearold who also heard from finchem and senate candidate jim lamon an alabamaborn businessman at the forum communication is a gift of hers another attendee said of lake i feel like shes going to speak the truth and not be so aggressive about it while lake throws bombs in her primary katie hobbs arizonas democratic secretary of state and the presumed frontrunner for her partys nomination for governor has been trying to steer clear of the wreckage hobbs is also someone youd recognize from tv at the height of the circus surrounding the 2020 election and the gops partisan election audit hobbs was on the cable news circuit providing commentary as arizonas top election official and blasting the partisan audit as a joke i met hobbs last month for morning coffee in an artsy neighborhood on the outskirts of downtown phoenix hobbs 52 wears her hair in a silvergray bob with cateye glasses she was friendly but guarded it was clear hobbs understands how the race will be framed if she and lake are opponents i dont want to say overshadow but the 2020 election is playing such a huge role in this race and not just the election overall but this race in particular hobbs said adding that lake is the biggest cheerleader promoting trumps lies about the election and my role defending all that hobbs role defending all that has become an allconsuming aspect of the job the former social worker has held since 2019 thats the situation ive been in for a while she said im not gonna back down from telling the truth of what happened that our elections were conducted with integrity and according to the laws that are in place that every voter can have confidence that the results are accurate and theres literally no evidence to the contrary defending the election also means that hobbs routinely faces violent threats which began pouring in regularly after her criticism of the partisan audit hobbs usually travels with a private security detail paid for by every eligible american a nonprofit against that backdrop hobbs paid extra close attention to a man who started scaling a parking structure in the middle of our interview it was weird but also not the kind of city occurrence you would necessarily bat an eye at unless you happened to be a frequent recipient of death threats hobbs looked rattled i dont think about it hobbs said of the specific threats shes faced since the 2020 election or else i would never leave my house while hobbs is well positioned for the democratic nomination her campaign has been dogged by a yearsold discrimination case brought by a former black female staffer for state senate democrats and the campaigns bungled response as the arizona senates top democrat at the time hobbs apologized for the staffers firing but it has become a potent line of attack for hobbs primary opponent former nogales mayor marco lopez hobbs told huffpost that she has taken responsibility and accountability for her role in the firing even with a candidate that some consider flawed democrats have a better shot of winning the governorship against a polarizing republican like lake who may have a tougher time pulling together a coalition of moderates and independents to win a general election in a diversifying state the presumptive gop frontrunner has tried to strengthen her appeal with plans to tackle border security and homelessness lake has mastered messaging around the media is bad trump was cheated out of the election big brothers forcing us to wear a mask as all that thats her game she talks it up better than anybody said tyler montague an arizonabased gop operative but shes a quarterinch deep she literally cant get off those topics otherwise shes in trouble carolina rodriguezgreer the arizona director for latino gotv organization mi familia vota said people are sick of looking back to the 2020 election when joe biden won the state by less than a percentage point setting off all manner of election conspiracy we still have people that believe that the election results were not true even though weve already gone through two audits that have been paid for by the taxpayers she said that narrative is extremely dangerous probably one of the more unexpected narratives to arise from the governors race came last month when phoenix drag star barbra seville aka richard stevens released photos and private messages he exchanged with lake over the course of their twodecade acquaintanceship stevens took issue with lake tweeting they kicked god out of schools and welcomed the drag queens they took down our flag and replaced it with a rainbow lake has also echoed gop hysteria over drag and grooming children according to stevens his former friend had once hired him to perform at a baby shower in drag in front of children a bomb meant to show lakes hypocrisy on the issue stevens also performed for lake once at her birthday and at some of the seediest bars in phoenix he wrote on facebook the story caused enough of a stir that lakes campaign sent a ceaseanddesist letter to stevens warning him to stop making certain claims about lake her campaign confirmed to the washington post that stevens was a friend and that lake once attended an event with a marilyn monroe impersonator a campaign spokesperson told the newspaper that stevens facebook post contained defamatory lies and that lake would pursue legal action lake and stevens bonded over makeup and madonna stevens said over the phone last month sounding almost wistful about his onetime friend he said lake started coming to his shows in the late 90s and they struck up a casual friendship that lasted years lakes campaign didnt respond to questions about her relationship with stevens i knew her as very levelheaded i found her to be middleoftheroad liberal she and i we didnt have indepth conversations about politics but it wasnt uncommon to talk about news and current events because thats what we bonded over he said the idea that lake isnt who she says she is has haunted her entry into politics and it might be what undoes her campaign i think karrin taylor robson will be the best person to be a fresh new leader for the state of arizona ducey arizonas governor said last weekend on cnn lending his political heft to lakes rival her opponent on the other hand bears no resemblance her campaign or even her personal interactions with me to anything shes done over the past 30 years this is all an act days later fox news uncovered a facebook post from lake where she called trump not my president just before his 2017 inauguration raising the question of exactly when lake became a fullthroated trump supporter fox reported the post disappeared from lakes page once a reporter had reached out for comment i cant imagine her as governor she couldnt lead a newsroom of 100 people she cant lead a state pike lakes former supervisor said lake makes it sound like shes everyman and shes not everyman adding that lake was well paid for working at the station something lake also acknowledges on the campaign trail when she discusses walking away from a very large salary a republican and a trump voter in 2016 pike posted critically on facebook about lakes run for governor and several of her former fox colleagues chimed in with similar comments taylor robsons campaign found pike and cast her in a campaign ad in which pike calls lake an actress and a pretender pike said she spoke out because many of her former colleagues are bound by nondisclosure agreements i just dont see kari as an ethical person an adult she said i cant imagine her as governor she couldnt lead a newsroom of 100 people she cant lead a state asked whether shes tried to bring up her concerns with how the news is being reported with her former colleagues lake said now i dont really have a lot of relationships with them im so busy lake continued every journalist pushes stories they push an interesting topic they want to get covered obviously those stories werent being covered so as a journalist when youre pushing them and theyre not being covered you start to read the writing on the wall and you go wow not an interest in these stories not an interest in the full truth and so i walked away
technology black friday is one of the few if only days of the year when apple acts like a normal retailer so as in years past the electronics maker is offering oneday deals to kick off the holiday shopping season but instead of price cuts on ipads and macbooks as apple has done on black fridays of yore it took a different tack in the us this year apple is including apple store gift cards valued between 25 and 150 with the fullpriced purchase of various products you can see all the deals on the companys website but weve listed out the very best apple black friday deals below some things though havent changed as was the case in 2012 and in 2011 apple is offering absolutely no deals on its bestselling product the iphone and thats not all check out all the deals here
politics the calls for transparency came quickly after mondays fbi raid of maralago the home and social club of former president donald trump in palm beach florida trump supporters in elected office demanded explanations from the justice department for the unprecedented search of the home of a former president and potential electoral rival for the sitting president why are the fbi and doj refusing to comment after raiding the private home of a former us president sen marsha blackburn rtenn a staunch trump ally wrote on twitter the american people demand transparency they do not want another political witch hunt of president trump even republicans who opposed trump wanted more details why was maralago raided and why was it raided now out of the agency often arguing the unprecedented move required the justice department to put aside standard procedure these are unprecedented circumstances that require unprecedented transparency and accountability from our government institutions said maryland gop gov larry hogan a frequent critic of trump who is considering a 2024 presidential bid the american people deserve to know all the facts as soon as possible and i call on the biden administration to release at a minimum the documents authorizing the fbi search the justice department however is sticking to its strict rules against discussing ongoing investigations amid recent experiences seeing how violations of those rules can quickly create unintended consequences the calls for transparency are likely to go unanswered at least in the shortterm but there is someone who is free to provide more information trump while trump was not at maralago during the raid fbi agents would have supplied one of his lawyers and employees with both a search warrant outlining the justification for the search and an inventory of everything agents ultimately seized the former president is free to release those documents some details have leaked out both from trump and from unnamed sources with knowledge of the investigation trump said the fbi broke into his safe for instance and multiple news outlets have reported the search dealt with an investigation into trumps decision to remove 15 boxes of white house documents some of them classified and bring them to maralago rather than with the justice departments investigation into the jan 6 insurrection tim purdon a former us attorney for north dakota during the obama administration explained the justice departments relative silence this way imagine the opposite scenario lets say merrick garland had appeared at a press conference at the gates of maralago and told the american people all of the evidence that made up the probable cause warrant in this case purdon said many many people would say how dare the ag the justice department go on and say they have this evidence without filing an indictment theyre taking away the defendants right to a fair trial purdons imagined reaction does reflect the bad faith in which many republican elected officials were certain to deploy if the justice department moved against trump but what about trump opponents like hogan who feel an unprecedented step requires unprecedented disclosures and explanations purdon says they likely wont have to wait for long this seems to be the sort of investigatory law enforcement action you take not at the beginning of an investigation but very close to the end of an investigation purdon said so whos to say that the government is not going to speak and be transparent sometime in the short term here and recent history shows the pratfalls of breaking from that policy former fbi director james comey trying to maintain his independence from the justice department under thenpresident barack obama repeatedly spoke out regarding the agencys investigation into the democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton the famous comey letter released weeks before the 2016 election may have tipped the election to trump after trump fired comey nowfbi director christopher wray said at his confirmation hearing he would not release derogatory information about suspects satisfying both democrats angry at the fbis treatment of clinton and republicans frustrated with leaks regarding the trump campaigns contacts with russia in the meantime however some democrats who did not want to openly comment on an investigation they know little about are fretting that the silence from the fbi and justice department could be filled with misinformation generated by trump and his allies thats part of the reason why some democrats have begun calling on trump to release the warrant and inventory from the search a step hes so far declined to take donald trump has a copy of the search warrant hed show us the warrant if he were so

social a couple of recent stories highlight schools turning to online fundraising to provide students with everything from basic classroom supplies to longdistance field trips nicole dobo who covers blended learning for the hechinger report looked at how more easily accessible and transparent online sites such as donorschooseorg are giving teachers a way to make direct appeals for help these days a website can reach a wider audience more efficiently these online tools for fundraising have streamlined the process for soliciting private donations to pay for materials and activities that are not supported by many public school budgets its understandable that donors would want accountability for how their dollars are actually spent and donorschooseorg provides that as npr reported more than 310 million has been raised for schools over the past 15 years admittedly as npr points out thats a drop in the bucket compared with the billions of dollars in local state and federal funding but its certainly dollars that many of those schools otherwise wouldnt have at their disposal many of these online requests are relatively modest a quick glance at the site brought me to a teacher in muskegon heights mich mrs d at martin luther king elementary is seeking 239 to buy headphones for her students to use a classroom computer activity center as of today she was halfway to her goal to be sure the internet can be a powerful springboard for schools consider the case of the brooklyn student interviewed by humans of new york who talked about a schoolwide effort to raise enough money to visit washington dc not only did the campaign rake in over 1 million in donations but both the student and his principal wound up in the oval office that being said feelgood stories like these shouldnt distract from the fact that plenty of schools across the country struggle to provide students with basic educational support never mind enrichment field trips or support services like eye exams or extra meals not all of those requests will get filled online in fact several states are facing lawsuits challenging the equity of their school funding formulas new york and texas are just two recent examples when it comes to money many schools and districts are facing problems that will take more than even the most successful fundraising campaigns to solve

health it sounds so obvious i know in fact youd think it would go without saying but training the mind meditating being mindful or whatever else we choose to call it only works if we actively engage with it more than that it only works if we practice it regularly preferably on a daily basis with a considered gentle discipline the obvious comparison is training the body perhaps to get fit or to lose some weight its not enough to have the membership card of the gym in our bag or the shiny new trainers at home hoping we might get fit by osmosis we need to actually turn up for the event to engage in physical exercise on a regular basis to experience the benefits the same is true of the mind here are my 10 top tips for making sure you develop a consistent practice and stay committed to maintaining a healthy mind 1 meditate first thing in the morning if you can it will ensure it gets done gets rid of any grogginess from your sleep and is a great way to start the day it will also mean you are more likely to be mindful throughout the day 2 if you choose to do it at another time of day prioritize it this means putting it in the diary and committing to it in the same way you would to any other kind of meeting whether it is 10 minutes or considerably longer nothing is more important than the health of your mind 3 think same time same place when you are looking to develop a new practice activity or habit this simple motto will dramatically increase the likelihood of you doing it try to create a conducive environment in which you can immediately relax into and make it part of your daily routine 4 some people find it useful to attach their meditation to another daily activity to strengthen the habit for example think tea and then meditation or perhaps shower and then meditation by doing this we integrate the practice into a wellestablished routine that already exists 5 be flexible no matter what if you intend to train the mind for the rest of your life you can be sure that there will be days when your routine is thrown out of shape dont let that be an excuse to skip a day just do it later instead it is always better to sit for a short while than not at all even if it is only a minute 6 avoid judging your meditation it is tempting to think you are good or bad at meditation in truth there is no such thing there is only distraction or nondistraction if you tell yourself you are bad at something you will lose all motivation and are unlikely to do it if you understand the purpose this will never be a problem 7 always reflect on the benefits of meditation at the end of the session notice how you feel physically mentally and emotionally the more you establish the connection between training the mind and feeling better clearer or calmer the easier it becomes to sit down and practice each day 8 keep an excuse book close to hand the idea of this is that when its time to do your meditation if you choose not to do it for any reason you write down why you are choosing not to do it it may sound strange but often when we see the excuse on paper we realize that we really do have the time and that it really does matter 9 find a buddy to do it with it doesnt have to be physically together or even at the same time but find a friend whos also looking to establish a regular practice and commit to helping each other out knowing that someone else is making an effort and may ask us if we have done it or not can help to strengthen our commitment 10 be realistic in your expectations training or taming the mind is a skill to develop over a lifetime sure there are some immediate benefits to be found but some take longer than others if expectations are too high then you may well feel disappointed and demotivated at some stage so just take one day at a time if youre looking for a way to begin restart or strengthen your daily commitment to meditation why not set yourself the mind man challenge and see if you can do 10 minutes every day for 10 days ive recorded a special program which is completely free to use and which you can access it online or as an app for iphone or android for more by andy puddicombe click here

economy at first glance the unemployment rate seems a lot less terrible than it did a few months ago in april at the start of the covid19 shutdown the jobless rate was a recordhigh 147 this month the labor department announced that the unemployment rate had dropped to 84 but digging deeper into the jobs report youll find nearly all the improvement in the unemployment rate over the past few months has been for white workers the black unemployment rate is still in double digits at 13 the rate for white workers is 73 nearly half of what it is for black workers in other words white workers are getting hired back nearly twice as fast as black workers as jobs are coming back theyre disproportionately going to white people said heidi shierholz director of policy at the progressive economic policy institute as job growth begins to slow down while the covid crisis drags on this will likely be catastrophic for black workers and the economy and theres little indication that policymakers care the declining overall unemployment rate has given republican lawmakers cover to do little to help jobless workers letting expanded unemployment insurance benefits expire in july with no replacement in sight the president is even out there bragging about the jobless numbers going back decades african american workers have always faced unemployment rates that were about twice as high as those of white workers the 21 ratio has held basically steady since 1972 when the labor department first started collecting data on the african american unemployment rate as gbenga ajilore a senior economist at the center for american progress explained in a paper published just before the coronavirus pandemic occasionally at the tail end of an economic recovery period the ratio will narrow a bit but until the early months of the covid crisis never all that dramatically what was initially different about the job losses that began this spring with the shutdown is that the racial gap narrowed quite a bit since workers got laid off en masse black and white workers lost jobs at similar and high rates plus because black workers disproportionately held a lot of jobs that were considered essential think grocery workers or other frontline workers they held on to that work not exactly great news since those jobs are often lowerpaying have little or no benefits and put workers at higher risk for covid19 back in april the unemployment rate for white workers was 142 and for black workers 167 since then the ratio has widened back out the blackwhite unemployment ratio since the pandemic march 2020 168 april 2020 118 may 2020 135 june 2020 152 july 2020 159 august 2020 178 not good mindthegap as long as weve been recording this data african americans are first fired last hired in this pandemic everyone got fired but african americans are still last hired ajilore told huffpost its one of those things where something gets knocked off its equilibrium and rolled back to its natural state most of the jobs getting added back to the economy right now arent newly created jobs but instead are mainly companies rehiring workers they were forced to lay off during the shutdown notes shierholz who is also a former chief economist for the us department of labor black people are getting left behind she said pointing out that theyre getting rehired at far slower rates to be clear this unemployment gap between black and white workers is a result of structural racism not anything inherently different between races research and the experience of people shows that employers are biased in who they hire who they promote and who they fire the unemployment gap holds across almost every education level even black veterans have a higher unemployment rate than white veterans i cant believe i have to say this but it is not because there is something about black people that makes them less employable said martha gimbel a senior manager of economic research at schmidt futures this isnt because of skills it is because of bias in hiring before the pandemic started trump liked to tout and take credit for the fact that unemployment rates for african americans were at historic lows but at its lowest level prepandemic the black unemployment rate was 54 still higher than the rate for whites 37 at that time there was never anything to brag about said ajilore he pointed out that when the white unemployment rate was at 54 no one saw that as a good resting point yet it was good news for african americans the message even then was african americans should be happy with an unemployment rate that white people wouldnt tolerate he said the postcoronavirus economy might widen the unemployment gap between white and black workers even more black women might have an even tougher struggle going back to work because of the increased child care burdens placed on parents right now and as state and local governments start laying off more workers to deal with budget shortfalls with no federal rescue in sight those job cuts are more likely to fall on african americans meanwhile the pandemic has widened educational disparities for black and white children long term that could mean worsening opportunities for those disadvantaged children when they enter the job market years from now ajilore said economists warn that the improvements weve seen in the unemployment rate over the past few months are petering out the pace of hiring is slowing said gimbel and the number of longterm unemployed people is growing black workers will be disproportionately represented in those ranks you have a tsunami of people barreling towards long term unemployment she said this is very bad

health we all know the mantra by now if you want to lose weight or prevent weight gain you have to exercise along with eating healthfully what kind of exercise why walking of course your doctor mumbles something about walking three or four times a week while writing out the requisitions for lab tests at the conclusion of your annual physical you want to ask how you are going to manage to do this under the blazing sun and humidity of the summer or the dark cold icy snowy days of winter or on leafslick sidewalks after a november rainstorm or if you can get another question in before being ushered out of the office where are you going to walk since you live in a neighborhood without sidewalks many cities or older suburban communities usually have sidewalks they may not be free of snow in the winter and cracked and jagged from old tree roots pushing up the pavement but at least residents dont have to walk on the road but this is not the case in many parts of the country where sidewalks and residential areas often part ways if walking is to be done it has to be on roads that often have no shoulders where one can stand to avoid being hit by a delivery truck or a mammoth suv if the side of the road has dense vegetation or rocks even standing there may be perilous since there is little space for ones feet more than once i have stayed at a hotel convention center for meetings in a suburban industrial park and have been forced to walk or run on highways with sand and pebbles flying in my face from passing trailer trucks and although some suburban communities often gated have roads relatively free of traffic the mindnumbing effect of walking round and round streets with only houses and not a store in sight is enough to send one inside walking is the easiest most convenient and least expensive way to exercise and there is data to support the notion that those who walk most may be the healthiest 1 new yorkers are supposed to be the fastest walkers in the country and may be among the healthiest today the life expectancy of a baby born in new york is 809 years which is 22 years more than the national average 2 of course these city residents dont walk just for the exercise it is often the most efficient and even fastest way for them to go from point a to point b the bureau of transportation statistics reported several years ago that in the summer of 2002 86 percent of the 205 million americans walked at least once and 40 percent walked more than 15 days per month the presence of sidewalks increased the tendency for adults to take walks and the bureau suggested that adding sidewalks to communities without them would increase the number by another 28 million in all fairness some of these nonsidewalk communities may have walking trails or parks 3 to be sure there are many alternative ways of exercising health clubs home treadmills recreational sports from skiing to swimming dancing rock climbing and more all of these will certainly use up calories increase stamina and bone strength and perhaps even cognitive acuity however unlike most of these other forms of exercise except perhaps biking and rollerblading walking permits multitasking which in our overly busy lives makes it a much more attractive form of exercise walking the dog with your children to their school to do errands to the post office to a doctors appointment to a neighbor or to a movie theater concert or restaurant means that the walker is not only burning calories but also accomplishing some other goal indeed there is a website called walkscore that evaluates over 10000 neighborhoods in 3000 cities for their walkability ie ease of doing errands and getting to recreational sites by foot lifestyle change is the buzzword defining what has to happen if the obese are to become and remain thin and the thin not to become obese the ability to walk in safety on sidewalks that lead to somewhere interesting must be part of this healthy lifestyle if people are to follow it those who are fortunate enough to live in neighborhoods with sidewalks and places to walk to are aware of the positive impact this has on their lives social interactions are as likely to involve taking a walk as sitting and eating being out on the sidewalk has often led to friendships among neighbors who otherwise always leave the house in a car to be sure having sidewalks and places to which to walk does not eliminate the discomfort and even hazards of bad weather dog owners who do not clean up after their pets and watching out for cars when streets have to be crossed but it certainly makes it easier to respond to the suggestion to get out and walk especially when it means you dont have to worry about finding a place to park your car

politics the house passed the right to contraception act on thursday a bill that codifies the right to birth control and other contraceptives amid fears that the supreme court may come for that aspect of reproductive health care next after the high court repealed roe v wades protection of abortion rights last month the bill passed despite 195 republicans who voted against the bill in a final vote of 228 to 195 republicans who voted against the legislation included reps matt gaetz fla paul gosar ariz jack bergman mich and joe wilson sc just eight republicans voted in favor of the bill the senate recently introduced a companion measure that will likely see a vote sometime next week despite the flurry of action on reproductive rights in the house all of the recently passed health care rights bills are likely doomed to die by filibuster in the senate the right to contraception act introduced by rep kathy manning dnc codifies the right to birth control into federal law by creating a statutory right for people to obtain and use contraceptives as well as codifying protections for physicians who provide contraceptives the bill protects a range of contraceptives approved by the food and drug administration and defines contraception as any action taken to prevent pregnancy including the use of contraceptives or fertilityawareness based methods and sterilization procedures the bill authorizes the department of justice to take civil action against any federal or state official who attempts to restrict birth control access and it allows those affected to also take civil action against anyone who attempts to enforce any restriction on contraception it is clear that their attempts to roll back the clock on contraception is again another plank on their extreme agenda for american women house speaker nancy pelosi dcalif said at a wednesday news conference before the vote let us be clear we are not going back for our daughters for our granddaughters pelosi added the legislation is a direct response to justice clarence thomas who wrote in a concurring opinion in the ruling that overturned roe that the court should also reconsider the landmark 1965 decision in griswold v connecticut which protects the right to buy and use contraceptives without government interference
science by natalie wolchover published 04202012 0112 pm edt on lifes little mysteries historical records indicate that worldwide witch hunts occur more often during cold periods possibly because people look for scapegoats to blame for crop failures and general economic hardship fitting the pattern scholars argue that cold weather may have spurred the infamous salem witch trials in 1692 the theory first laid out by the economist emily oster in her senior thesis at harvard university eight years ago holds that the most active era of witchcraft trials in europe coincided with a 400 year period of lowerthanaverage temperature known to climatologists as the little ice age oster now an associate professor of economics at the university of chicago showed that as the climate varied from year to year during this cold period lower temperatures correlated with higher numbers of witchcraft accusations the correlation may not be surprising oster argued in light of textual evidence from the period popes and scholars alike clearly believed witches were capable of controlling the weather and therefore crippling food production the salem witch trials fell within an extreme cold spell that lasted from 1680 and 1730 one of the chilliest segments of the little ice age the notion that weather may have instigated those trials is being revived by salem state university historian tad baker in his forthcoming book a storm of witchcraft oxford university press 2013 building on osters thesis baker has found clues in diaries and sermons that suggest a harsh new england winter really may have set the stage for accusations of witchcraft according to the salem news one clue is a document that mentions a key player in the salem drama rev samuel parris whose daughter betty was the first to become ill in the winter of 16911692 because of supposed witchcraft in that document rev parris is arguing with his parish over the wood supply baker said a winter fuel shortage would have made for a fairly miserable colonial home and the higher the misery quotient the more likely you are to be seeing witches psychology obviously played an important role in the salem events the young girls who accused their fellow townsfolk of witchcraft are believed to have been suffering from a strange psychological condition known as mass hysteria however the new theory suggests the hysteria may have sprung from dire economic conditions the witchcraft trials suggest that even when considering events and circumstances thought to be psychological or cultural key underlying motivations can be closely related to economic circumstances oster wrote weather patterns continue to trigger witchcraft accusations in many parts of africa where witch killings persist according to a 2003 analysis by the berkeley economist edward miguel extreme rainfall either too much or too little coincides with a significant increase in the number of witch killings in tanzania the victim is typically the oldest woman in a household killed by her own family we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again follow natalie wolchover on twitter nattyover follow lifes little mysteries on twitter llmysteries and join us on facebook

reactions in our brain and body that would surprise most of us if we knew the whole story well just in time for valentines day sheril kirshenbaum science writer and author of the recent book the science of kissing what our lips are telling us sheds light on exactly what goes on biologically when we lock lips kissing basically acts like a drug by stimulating the natural chemicals in our bodies yet unlike other human behaviors science has barely begun to put kissing under the microscope to study this intriguing evolutionary behavior says sheril who serves as director of the university of

most meaningful messages will be exchanged without spending a dime its kisses that leave the most indelible impression of all our lips are packed with sensitive nerve endings so that even the slightest brush sends a flurry of information to our brains that often feels very good although we often dont think of them in this way our lips are the bodys most exposed erogenous zone when they are involved in a passionate kiss our blood vessels dilate as our brain receives more oxygen than normal our pulse quickens and our breathing can become irregular our cheeks flush as our pupils dilate causing many of us to close our eyes five of our 12 cranial nerves jump into action as we engage all of our senses in interpreting whats going on and anticipating what may happen next when theres real chemistry between two individuals a kiss sparks romance by triggering a cocktail of hormones and neurotransmitters that cascade through our bodies and brains in this manner locking lips serves as humanitys most intimate experience because it conveys more than our words can possibly express its natures ultimate litmus test telling us when to pursue a deeper connection with someone special or to step back because were incompatible with a partner and understanding the science behind how this happens doesnt take any magic out of the moment instead it provides a better understanding and

worldnews washington ap two weeks into its war in ukraine russia has achieved less and struggled more than anticipated at the outset of the biggest land conflict in europe since world war ii but the invading force of more than 150000 troops retains large and possibly decisive advantages in firepower as they bear down on key cities moscows main objective toppling the kyiv government and replacing it with kremlinfriendly leadership remains elusive and its overall offensive has been slowed by an array of failings including a lack of coordination between air and ground forces and an inability to fully dominate ukraines skies the pentagon on tuesday estimated that russia retains about 95 of the combat power it has deployed in ukraine accounting for weapons and vehicles destroyed or made inoperable as well as troops killed and wounded those losses while modest at first glance are significant for two weeks of fighting two weeks of war have created a humanitarian crisis in ukraine that has accelerated in recent days the united nations estimates that 2 million ukrainians have fled their country and the number is expected to grow russia likely has had between 2000 and 4000 troops killed thus far said lt gen scott berrier director of the defense intelligence agency adding that his agency has low confidence in its estimate with no sign of russian president vladimir putin backing away the war appears likely to drag on cia director william burns told a congressional panel tuesday that putin is frustrated and likely to double down in ukraine he said that could mean an ugly next few weeks as the fighting intensifies whether and how the conflict might expand is a major concern in the west not least because putin has said he will not tolerate unlimited us or nato arms supplies to ukraine nato in turn has warned against the russian conflict spilling over ukraines border into a nato country like poland or romania poland on tuesday offered to transfer mig29 fighter jets to us control at an air base in germany presumably leaving to washington the question of whether and how to get the planes to ukraine the pentagon quickly shot down the idea calling it untenable in light of ukraines contested airspace some worry that a frustrated putin could escalate the conflict in dangerous ways a few days into the war he invoked the prospect of nuclear war by announcing he had put his nuclear forces on heightened alert although us officials detected no threatening changes in russias nuclear posture as he weighs an escalation of the conflict putin probably still remains confident that russia can militarily defeat ukraine and wants to prevent western support from tipping the balance and forcing a conflict with nato avril haines the director of national intelligence told congress on tuesday although a detailed picture of the unfolding war is difficult to acquire american and european officials and analysts say the russians started slowly and have since been hobbled by a combination of inadequate planning flawed tactics and possibly an erosion of spirit among troops not ready to fight on the opening day of the war the pentagon estimated that only about onethird of prestaged russian combat forces had entered ukraine with the remaining twothirds coming in gradually until nearly all were in this week the russian troops have made incremental progress but their pace has been remarkably slow they are having morale problems said john kirby the pentagons chief spokesman they are having supply problems they are having fuel problems theyre having food problems they are meeting a very stiff and determined ukrainian resistance and we still maintain that they are several days behind what they probably thought they were going to be in terms of their progress kirby said the pentagon believes that the russians slow pace of advance by ground troops has prompted them to make greater use of rockets artillery and other longrange weapons including in urban areas that has resulted in more civilian casualties he said we think its because again they have not been able to make up for the lost time that they continue to suffer from on the ground in terms of the advancement of ground forces kirby said at lviv train station where thousands have gathered in hopes of fleeing the crowds remain very calm with almost no pushing despite the hours of waiting kpfaffenbach has more pictwittercomrrc0mb9tzm after staging more than 150000 troops on ukraines borders the russians launched their invasion feb 24 pressing south toward kyiv from points in southern belarus and russia toward kharkiv the largest city in eastern ukraine and north from the crimean peninsula which russia has occupied since 2014 ukrainians mounted a fiercer resistance than putin likely expected even as russian missile and rocket attacks on cities have caused civilian casualties damaged and destroyed civilian infrastructure and triggered an accelerating exodus of refugees seeking safety in poland and beyond jens stoltenberg the nato secretarygeneral said friday that russia may have underestimated the degree to which ukraines armed forces had improved since 2014 as a result of us and nato training and this is the reason why they are able to push back as effectively as they have stoltenberg said philip breedlove a retired air force general who was natos top commander in europe from 2013 to 2016 said that although russian forces are far behind schedule he believes they are capable of eventually taking kyiv unless there is a big operationallevel change they have enough of what i call slow steady momentum that if they can stand the losses it will give them they will eventually accomplish that objective he said that raises questions about a russian occupation and the potential for an insurgency breedlove said the russian offensive in southern ukraine has been less bogged down than in the north and is designed to establish a land bridge between the southeastern donbas region to the crimean peninsula and west to the black sea port city of odesa which would make ukraine a landlocked country associated press writers lorne cook in brussels and nomaan merchant in washington contributed to this report

least on paper thats because of the us houses continued use of proxy voting in which lawmakers allow other lawmakers to cast their vote while theyre absent crist used proxy voting to vote for the inflation reduction act in midaugust even as he had a full schedule of getoutthevote events set for the next day in florida with the heart of the midterm campaign season looming in september crists case shows a tempting use of proxy voting for something other than public health to allow lawmakers to skip being in the house in favor of being on the campaign trail and with proxies becoming more widely used since 2020 this fall could see a rise in absentee voting as lawmakers weigh the practical value of being in the house chamber where votes are usually seen as predetermined versus pressing the flesh back home technically house members are only supposed to use proxy voting when they are physically unable to attend proceedings in the house chamber due to the ongoing public health emergency its part of a rules change that was passed in may 2020 to allow members to cast votes even if they could not be present due to the covid19 pandemic but there is no procedure to verify a members reason for using it and no limits on how often proxy voting can be used crist was by no means alone in voting by proxy on the climate and tax bill house records indicate some 158 members or more than a third of the entire house declared they were unable to attend due to covid19 on that friday in august and while crist may be a prolific user of proxy voting he is by no means alone or even the biggest user on the campaign trail that title may belong to rep tim ryan dohio who is running for the us senate and had given his proxy 42 times in the current congress as of late august compared with crists 23 crists office did not return a request for comment about his use of proxy voting while ryan said remote voting should be a permanent option the year is 2022 we can walk and chew gum at the same time and members of congress should be able to use the technology at our disposal to do our jobs while also meeting facetoface with the people we serve taking care of kids and more he said we need to be together we need to be looking at each other we need to be talking to each other the job of a member of congress pays 174000 a year usually requires inperson attendance at the capitol only three to four days a week and comes with plenty of formal and informal perks perhaps thats why proxy voting hasnt been embraced by some members including some of the old guard the body needs to be in the building rep frank lucas a 15term oklahoma republican told huffpost before lawmakers left for their august break we need to be together we need to be looking at each other we need to be talking to each other and if youre not physically able to do that for a twoyear period then maybe you should assess whether youre a member or not he said republicans have argued house speaker nancy pelosi dcalif has kept extending the temporary allowance of proxy voting to make it easier for democrats to win close legislative votes with their narrow threemember majority and house gop leader kevin mccarthy calif has vowed to end the practice if republicans take control after novembers midterms if you think about it thats the story of this democrat majority they will destroy our economy and mortgage your future but cant be personally bothered to show up to make the trip to dc to do their jobs what a disgrace mccarthy said during the inflation reduction act debate but while democrats have been much more open to using proxy voting many republicans have lost their initial wariness and begun to embrace it one republican rep brad wenstrup ohio was spotted at a washington area airport only hours after attending a press conference at the capitol but before the inflation reduction act vote in which he voted by proxy according to brookings institute researchers 144 of the then213 house gop members had used proxy voting at least once in the current congress through december of 2021 a number thats likely grown since on average republicans voted by proxy 29 times during that period compared with 54 times for democrats rep steny hoyer md the secondranking house democrat told reporters in july he sees a need for proxy voting even as he thinks its use may need to be tightened to prevent abuse im not one of those thats lathered up about proxy voting he said the pandemics not over theres no doubt however that people are using it for convenience not health on both sides of the aisle hoyer said we need to deal with it so we have a policy that is a rational one but also one that lets people be heard when theyre sick or something or when their family members are sick so it will only be in september that it will get bad before the election as a former chairman of the national republican congressional committee rep pete sessions texas has little doubt proxies will be used more this fall so members can keep campaigning on the bright side the house is already out of session until the second full week of september and is scheduled to be out for all of october so it will only be in september that it will get bad before the election he told huffpost lucas the oklahoma republican said there are legitimate reasons to use proxy voting and noted he used it himself after his wife had hip replacement surgery members of congress are no different than normal people given an inch most people will take a foot he said
social c m rubins global education report from canada china the us and the uk in december i continued my conversations with world leaders on the frontiers of education reform these leaders from canada china america and the uk all share a commitment to transforming education at the ground level so that the poorest and most disadvantaged schools can become sites for development of innovative education and can create smart and employable future citizens from canada i talked to mary jean gallagher chief student achievement officer of ontario and assistant deputy minister of the student achievement division of the ontario ministry of education about the extensive educational turnaround in ontario the statistics are proof of the significant success for instance over the past decade the percentage of students meeting provincial standards in the annual literacy and numeracy tests for grades three and six has risen from 54 percent to 71 percent and the high school graduation rate has increased from 68 percent to 83 percent gallagher explains that this was caused by offering support at multiple levels of the system support is provided in the form of advice shared research into effective practices opportunities for exchanging insights among peers and the funding per school 15000 for release time out of the normal work schedule for planning monitoring reflecting on and integrating what is being learned into classroom practice from china i talked to jiang xueqin deputy principal of highly regarded tsinghua university high school about how to offer progressive education in a nation where the gap between rich and poor is immense this requires creating programs early on for the disadvantaged children in china investing in vocational programs and building a national system of community colleges he also spoke of his teaching philosophy it requires tremendous emotional intelligence selfunderstanding wisdom maturity and confidence to maintain a minimal interventionist attitude while offering nonjudgmental support and encouragement teachers and students are the real stars of any great school and real education leadership means playing a backstage and supporting role from the united states i talked to harvard professor howard gardner about how his innovative concept good grit meaning the combination of character and drive can be applied to education systems across the globe gardner was joined by jeffrey beard from the uk former director general of the international baccalaureate organization now founder and chairman of global study pass gardner and beard show that good grit is a breakthrough concept in education reform and can pave the way for students to do better in the increasingly competitive global marketplace moreover gardner and beard suggest that good grit will lead to a more collaborative and ethical future in the words of gardner if you simply want to have the most toys at the end of life you might get away with bad or compromised grit but if you pursue goals beyond selfaggrandizement then you can do well both for yourself and for the world and even if you dont aim to change the world being truthful and trustworthy

health most of us value our health and do what we believe will promote it i say believe because much of peoples behavior in the service of improving their health is based on faith not fact this is an understandable state of affairs where we lack the data it is a curious thing when solid data is ignored recent research now indicates that any healthy man who takes a common dose of vitamin e 400 iu or selenium 200 mcg may be increasing his risk for prostate cancer turning a blind eye to information about alcohol or cigarettes is no mystery we usually ignore directives that would rob us of a pleasurable or addictive habit but to similarly ignore data about something we use expressly to promote our health that provides no pleasure is not as easily understood about half of adult americans take a supplement daily between 1996 and 2006 supplement sales increased by 100 percent in 2010 americans spent 28 billion on these products this is all the more remarkable because during this same period reputable research repeatedly demonstrated the failure of supplements to prevent the occurrence or progression of any major illness such as cardiovascular disease or cancer surveys have shown that the people who take supplements are for the most part educated have good incomes and eat sensibly this is a population that is least likely to have deficiencies of vitamin e or selenium ironically the increased risk for prostate cancer associated with supplementation of these nutrients is thought to be a result of supraphysiological higher than normal levels in other words welleducated economicallycomfortable men who eat sensibly are most vulnerable to the cancer inducing effects of these supplements it is of note that interest in this area began with laboratory research suggesting that vitamin e and selenium might decrease the risk of prostate cancer this data lead to the selenium and vitamin e cancer prevention trial select in 2001 35533 healthy men were randomized into four groups selenium with matching placebo vitamin e with matching placebo both agents or placebo alone data analysis in 2008 revealed no risk reduction in fact there appeared to be an increased risk of prostate cancer in the vitamin e plus placebo group that approached statistical significance in 2011 klein et al provided a followup report the data now demonstrated that healthy men with average risk of prostate cancer who took a common dose and formulation of vitamin e 400 iud had a significantly increased risk 17 percent of prostate cancer selenium supplementation appeared to have no effect both findings were unexpected a previous study the nutritional prevention of cancer trial npc had found that supplementation in men with moderate and low selenium levels appeared to significantly decrease risk for prostate cancer no effect on men with high selenium levels was observed in the most recent addition to this story investigators sought to clarify the effect of prestudy selenium levels in select subjects they wanted to revisit the question of how vitamin e and selenium interact this combination was known to have a synergistic effect on cancer prevention in some animal models again the results were unanticipated they observed no association between selenium levels and prostate cancer in the absence of supplementation selenium supplementation did not benefit those with low selenium levels the vitamin e results were more troubling supplementation with vitamin e increased the risk of prostate cancer among men with low selenium levels for those with high selenium levels both selenium alone and selenium plus vitamin e increased the risk of highgrade prostate cancer prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in american men in 2014 233000 new cases will be diagnosed and 29480 will die of this disease most cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed early and can be successfully treated the cure however can be costly incontinence and impotence caused by treatment is common for a man to increase his risk for this disease by taking supplements hoping to enhance his health is tragic supplements are not benign agents that can only help or at worst do nothing a growing literature suggests that the effect of supplementation is largely defined by the nutrient status of the individual supplementation of those with adequate nutrient status can increase cancer risk surveys indicate that this is who takes supplements clearly our biology is complex it is particularly unsettling to find that replenishing low levels of an important compound with supplements causes harm for instance we know that oxidation can cause disease to assume that supplementing a low antioxidant vitamin e or selenium level would have beneficial effects is logical it may even work in a test tube or lab animal however this research adds to a growing literature that suggests that antioxidant supplementation can be harmful the investigators recommend that men aged greater than 55 should avoid supplementation at doses that exceed recommended dietary intakes for vitamin e 224 iuday and selenium 55 mcgday too much of a good thing could kill you

politics elsa avila slid to her phone terrified as she held the bleeding side of her abdomen and tried to stay calm for her students in a text to her family that she meant to send to fellow uvalde teachers she wrote im shot for the first time in 30 years avila will not be going back to school as classes resume tuesday in the small southwest texas city the start of school will look different for her as for other survivors of the may 24 shooting at robb elementary school in which 21 people died with an emphasis on healing both physically and mentally some have opted for virtual education others for private school many will return to uvalde school district campuses though robb elementary itself will never reopen im trying to make sense of everything avila said in an august interview but it is never going to make sense a scar down her torso brings her to tears as a permanent reminder of the horror she endured with her 16 students as they waited in their classroom for an hour for help while a gunman slaughtered 19 children and two teachers in two adjoining classrooms nearby minutes before she felt the sharp pain of the bullet piercing her intestine and colon avila was motioning students away from the walls and windows and closer to her a student lined up by the door for recess had just told her something was going on outside people were running and screaming as she slammed the classroom door so the lock would catch her students took their wellpracticed lockdown positions moments later a gunman stormed into their fourthgrade wing and began spraying bullets before ultimately making his way into rooms 111 and 112 in room 109 avila repeatedly texted for help according to messages reviewed by the associated press first at 1135 am in the text to her family that she says was meant for the teacher group chat then at 1138 in a message to the schools vice principal at 1145 she responded to a text from the schools counselor asking if her classroom was on lockdown with im shot send help and when the principal assured her that help was on the way she replied simply help yes they are coming the principal wrote back at 1148 am its unclear whether her messages were relayed to police district officials did not respond to requests for comment on actions taken to communicate with law enforcement on may 24 and an attorney for thenprincipal mandy gutierrez was not available for comment according to a legislative committees report that described a botched police response nearly 400 local state and federal officers stood in the hallway of the fourthgrade wing or outside the building for 77 minutes before some finally entered the adjoining classrooms and killed the gunman lawmakers also found a relaxed approach to lockdowns which happened often and security concerns including issues with door locks state and federal investigations into the shooting are ongoing the district is working to complete new security measures and the school board in august fired the districts police chief pete arredondo residents say it remains unclear how or even if trust between the community and officials can be rebuilt even as some call for more accountability better police training and stricter gun safety laws avila recalls hearing the ominous bursts of rapid fire then silence then the voices of officers in the hallway yelling crossfire and later more officers standing nearby but still nobody came to help us she said as avila lay motionless unable to speak loud enough to be heard some of her students nudged and shook her she wished for the strength to tell them she was still alive a light flashed into their window but nobody identified themselves scared it might be the gunman the students moved away the little girls closest to me kept patting me and telling me its going to be ok miss we love you miss avila said finally at 1233 pm a window in her classroom broke officers arrived to evacuate her students the last to be let out in the area according to avila with her remaining strength avila pulled herself up and helped usher students onto chairs and tables and through the window then clutching her side she told an officer she was too weak to jump herself he came through the window to pull her out i never saw my kids again i know they climbed out the window and i could just hear them telling them run run run avila said she remembers being taken to the airport where a helicopter flew her to a san antonio hospital she was in and out of care until june 18 avila later learned that a student in her class was wounded by shrapnel to the nose and mouth but had since been released from medical care she said other students helped their injured classmates until officers arrived i am very proud of them because they were able to stay calm for a whole hour that we were in there terrified avila said as her students prepare to return to school for the first time since that traumatic day avila is on the way to recovery walking up to eight minutes at a time on the treadmill in physical therapy and going to counseling she looks forward to teaching again someday outside of a shuttered robb elementary a memorial for the people killed overflows at the entrance gate teachers from across texas stopped by this summer to pay their respects and reflect on what they would do in the same situation if i survive i have to make sure they

social in 2003 the louisiana legislature created a staterun recovery school district rsd that allowed the louisiana board of elementary and secondary education bese to assume control over schools with a school performance score sps of 60 or below in august 2005 hurricane katrina destroyed new orleans and in november 2005 the louisiana legislature used such destruction to assume control of even more schools by raising the failing school score to an sps below the thencurrent average of 874 for more on the rsd history see this post note that a key component in sps calculation is the standardized test score on the high school level one such test score is the act which has been administered to all juniors beginning with the 201213 school year moreover 100 percent of louisianas class of 2013 took the act an overarching goal of state takeover of louisiana schools was for the state to assume control of most new orleans public schools which it did in 2005 and to convert all of those formerly localboardrun schools into charter schools which it did by may 2014 louisianas rsd new orleans rsdno was an experiment one that was supposed to turn around those failing schools and make the rsd charter conversion a modernday miracle by 2017 twelve years postkatrina it is clear that the experiment has failed there is no incredible testscorebased miracle and in no place is such failure more obvious than in the average act composite scores for rsdno in general and its high schools individually the remainder of this post offers a close examination of the average act composite scores for rsdno where the miracleproducing engine has stalled on august 09 2017 the louisiana department of education ldoe released the class of 2017 average act composite scores by school and school district what is not included among the released school and district scores is a class of 2017 average act composite score for the new orleans high schools that were taken over by the state postkatrina and which comprised the recovery school district new orleans rsdno in fact the ldoe class of 2016 average act composite score file also fails to include a separate score for rsdno high schools in may 2016 the louisiana legislature voted to begin returning rsdno schools to the orleans parish school board opsb a decision that provided a convenient reason for louisiana state superintendent john white to stop reporting the annual average act composite scores for rsdno as a separate score beginning with the class of 2012 the statereported average act composite score for rsdno high schools has been an embarrassment making state takeover arguably a difficult sell for the likes of a corporate reformer like white white was never able to tout rsdno high schools as having an average act composite that even reached as low as 170 in fact the best rsdno average act composite score happened several years ago in 2012 when rsdno reached 168 in order to offer some context regarding the meaning of act composite values note that in order for a high school graduate to gain unconditional admission to louisiana state university lsu shehe must have an act composite score of 22 then by ldoes own reporting it dropped to 163 in 2013 see louisiana reform voice leslie jacobs downplay the 2013 act drop to 163 in this new orleans miracle sales pitch and up it came modestly in 2014 to 164 that year white did not release louisianas composite act scores at all i released them in january 2015 with the assistance of someone in higher ed who became tired of waiting on white within days of my release which had rsdno high schools at 157 for an average class of 2014 composite white released his 164 comparison of his numbers to the ones i obtained begs for an audit but for now lets go with whites 164 which is nothing to showboat and which sure does appear to be a key reason that white did not release the scores in a timely manner in the first place in 2015 ldoe reported that rsdnos average act composite was 166 and before the time came for a class of 2016 act score release the louisiana legislature decided to begin sending rsdno schools back to opsb of course since those rsdno schools are now charter schools their return to opsb isnt the same as if the schools were traditional public schools as danielle dreilinger reported in may 2016 in nolacom even though opsb will be overseeing the nowreturning rsdno schools in marketdrivenreform portfolio style which adds a layer of bureaucracy that complicates oversight such a return is a real gift to john white white will be able to better conceal the rsdno actscore embarrassment by averaging rsdno high schools with those of opsb and never ever have to report a separate average act composite score on those rsdno high schools ever again from 2012 to 2015 ldoe reported opsb and rsdno average act scores separately but it also reported them combined which helped to draw attention away from just how low the rsdno high school act composite scores were and the rsdno average composites which were themselves low ranging from 163 to 168 over the fouryear span of 2012 to 2015 actually helped conceal the fact that a number of rsdno high schools continued to have act composite scores below 16 and that many rsdno school act composites from year to year continue to be erratic rsdno school and act composites for classes of 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 and 2012 if indeed state takeover of rsdno high schools made a substantial difference to testing outcomes the preferred measure of success promoted by corporate reform then that difference would arguably manifest itself in some sort of consistent upward trend in rsdno act scores across years for most rsdno high schools such evidence simply does not exist if it did you best believe john white would be broadcasting it instead he is left to combine rsdno and opsb high schools in order to produce a more publiclypalatable average act composite however even this will get old because the rsdno high schools low act composites are now producing what appears to be a stagnant rsdnoopsb combined composite that cannot break a modest 190 average composite opsb and rsdno combined act composite scores for years 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 below are the act composite scores for opsb without rsdno for 2015 2014 2013 and 2012 ldoe did not report opsb separately from rsdno in 2016 and 2017 in contrast to erratic and lowscoring rsdno nonstaterun opsb high schools did show a steady upward trend in average act composite scores one could argue that many opsb schools are selective admission schools that did not fit the states definition of failing in the first place and therefore should not be compared to the staterun rsdno schools however state turnover does not get off so easily the point of state takeover is to turn around failing schools and after over a decade such turnaround should be clearly evident in staterun rsdno act scores but it isnt not by a long long shot state takeover of rsdno high schools did not successfully turn around those schools indeed such failure is profoundly underscored by the fact that rsdno success cannot be marketed without concealing rsdno act scores behind that combined opsbrsdno act score averaging and even combined rsdnoopsb continues to unsuccessfully reach for an average act composite of 190 originally posted

economy stock photography is synonymous with outdated and ridiculous gender stereotypes theres women laughing alone with salad a viral meme that has morphed into women laughing alone with tablets and the many shots of alpha men sitting at the head of boardroom tables or barbecuing steaks the models in all these examples are usually white and extremely heteronormative but stock photo companies are increasingly trying to reflect our current culture in the past few years getty adobe and shutterstock have all tried to break away from the cliches theyre known for reinforcing especially as a new crop of stock photo startups focus exclusively on diverse images giants like getty started with tackling female stereotypes teaming up with sheryl sandberg in 2014 to create the lean in collection which shows women working in labs and hiking no romaine lettuce in sight now the company is turning its lens on men by focusing on the theme of masculinity undone getty recently released a compilation of images that feature men parenting hugging one another and looking pensive as they stare out windows launched in january the photos include men of color men with long hair and men who are shirtless despite lacking welldefined pecs and biceps were trying to focus on imagery that represents a more complex version of manhood and a more gentle side guy merrill gettys global head of art told huffpost were breaking away from stereotypes the business leader the absent father and buffoon the lonely guy who doesnt need any friends or community shutterstock has created a modern man collection full of male nurses gay couples and guys who love to garden while adobe is showcasing the fluid self which includes photos of men wearing makeup earrings and dressed in drag as well as portraits of the transgender community the shift comes amid an ongoing cultural conversation about what it means to be a man theres been a backlash against the type of aggressive authoritative manliness embodied by president donald trump and white nationalists along with a growing awareness that men struggle with mental illness and high suicide rates todays hip young male celebrities are less macho in appearance and demeanor think timothee chalamet and harry styles jayz talks openly about being in therapy jaden smith wears dresses and in every episode of queer eye the netflix makeover series a man breaks down in tears advertisers have taken note last year axe body spray launched a campaign called is it ok for guys that tackles the vulnerabilities men are taught to suppress is it ok to be skinny is it ok to be depressed and lululemon released videos of men talking about emotional strength stock photo companies say data client feedback and cultural trends have pushed them to focus on changing definitions of masculinity and gender fluidity in the past few years getty searches for man meditation went up by 126 percent man looking worried by 100 percent and gay dads by 53 percent according to the company a recent shutterstock survey found that 41 percent of us marketers think its important to use images that reflect modern day society younger people are getting into college and moving into the workforce and they have much more modern ideas about masculinity and femininity said robyn lange shutterstocks curator theres no longer buckets you place these genders into its more of a spectrum in theory stock photography is wellpoised to help people think more progressively about gender these images are ubiquitous appearing on billboards and storefronts and in online articles and videos where they are constantly tempting us to take out loans travel to hawaii and whiten our teeth people arent aware of how much stock theyre seeing every day everywhere on every platform said brenda mills adobes principal of creative services and visual trends and so it has a huge influence over peoples lives raising the visibility of men with regular bodies being emotionally vulnerable or working in traditionally female jobs would allow them to become normal aspects of masculinity rather than effeminate anomalies part of what we need are images to help us create a new reality said tristan bridges an assistant sociology professor at the university of california santa barbara what would it look like if men and women didnt have to wear different types of clothes or we didnt have to imagine them in different types of jobs but giorgia aiello an associate media and communication professor at the university of leeds in england who studies stock photos sees these diversity collections as branding exercises a way to appear cutting edge rather than to truly change gender norms although getty images in particular tries to really confer a political kind of tone to what they are doing with stock photography in the end the bottom line is purely commercial she said in some ways it is good they are doing it but its certainly not going to really deeply affect their business model stock photo businesses have little control over what their photographers shoot and how clients use those images getty and shutterstock both have more than 200000 contributors ranging from iphone amateurs to professionals who all earn royalties every time their work is licensed while companies send out reports detailing the type of shots they want more men sitting in half lotus please once contributors have been accepted onto the platform they can upload whatever images they choose so long as they arent offensive or illegal gettys lean in collection for example represents just 001 percent of the companys more than 190 million images if someone wants to shoot pictures of women eating salad despite all the memes we cant stop them said merrill though he noted that getty art directors are working directly with some of their professional contributors on masculinity undonethemed shoots stock photo companies also have no control over how clients use the photos in 2007 gettys topselling image for the search term woman was a halfnaked woman lying on a bed now its a woman hiking a rocky trail but aiello said that doesnt necessarily equal progress she has found that photos from the lean in collection most often appeared in lightweight lifestyle articles or articles on gender discrimination quite a few of these images showing women as scientists were not used in general science journalism she said but in articles that talked about how difficult it was for women to have a career in science while its possible that images of diverse masculinity will be confined to pieces about fashion or the evolution of manhood rather than used to illustrate more general topics adobes mills doesnt think thats a problem her fashion and grooming clients currently have the biggest appetite for nonstereotypical images of men she said because those photos help them reach a new market but more companies have begun to show interest im surprised by some of the clients who i thought might be more conservative being incredibly open to this fluid self trend mills said theyre actually incredibly hungry for it gettys merrill said that even if his customers arent begging for more nuanced photos of men his team has a responsibility to push them in a more progressive direction we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you

politics in an odd spectacle on sunday senate democrats argued among themselves and overwhelmingly voted against one of their own top policy priorities before coming together to pass one of the landmark bills of joe bidens presidency sen bernie sanders ivt tried to amend the bill to include an extension of the monthly child allowance that democrats enacted on a temporary basis last year but couldnt continue due to opposition from sen joe manchin dwva pathetically the united states has the highest child poverty rate of almost any major country on earth sanders said unfortunately for the millions of working parents who benefited from this program it expired in december sens sherrod brown dohio and michael bennet dcol two of the strongest proponents of the child tax credit rose in opposition to sanders amendment not because they didnt like it but because its adoption would have jeopardized the cheaper prescription drugs and billions for green energy promised by the inflation reduction act i ask my great colleagues to vote no because this will bring the bill down brown said nevertheless sanders persisted asking brown to explain how the child tax credit would harm the broader bill brown said that all 50 senate democrats supported the legislation and suggested that adding the child tax credit would cost them their unanimity we know that this is a fragile arrangement and weve got to pass it brown said as the senates presiding officer explained browns time was up the gravellyvoiced ohio democrat could be heard on cspan grumbling about his colleague come on bernie he said the sanders amendment then failed by a vote of 97 to 1 one of dozens of amendments rejected by the senate the expanded child tax credit democrats created in 2021 paid parents as much as 300 per child each month for six months the credit dramatically reduced child poverty and gave american parents a taste of the kind of child allowance that for decades has been a standard part of the welfare state in other rich countries but manchin complained that parents in his state wasted the money on drugs and refused to go along with a bill continuing the benefit as part of the build back better agenda after 2021 senate majority leader chuck schumer dny continued negotiating with manchin on the parts of build back better that he could support such as investments in green energy and allowing medicare to negotiate prescription drugs and their talks ultimately resulted in the senate passing the inflation reduction act on sunday bennet said sunday he would work with people on both sides of the aisle to make the enhanced child tax credit permanent but it remains to be seen whether a critical mass of republicans would ever support a monthly allowance for parents sen mitt romney rutah has proposed a different version of the democrats child tax credit with the cost of the program offset by consolidating and eliminating other safety net programs such as temporary assistance for needy families romneys proposal would also exclude benefits for parents with no incomes likely blunting some of its antipoverty impact romney has had informal conversations with bennet and brown and said he thought more formal negotiations could begin after the senates august recess he also said he thought he could win over more than the two republicans who had signed on to his proposal so far were not in a big hurry romney told huffpost we anticipate that this will probably be a number of months before something like this gets adopted the white house has shown interest in his proposal romney said but he didnt know if president biden would support it the white house did not respond to a request for comment its not clear how much energy there will be to strike another bipartisan deal after senators previously collaborated on gun control and subsidies for the domestic computer chip industry republicans may prefer to avoid giving biden another legislative victory ahead of midterm elections that could boost their ranks in the house and senate romney wouldnt say if he thought the overturning of roe v wade and the loss of abortion access for millions of women would spur more

social donald trumps first budget proposal is a nightmare for children ironically named america first a budget blueprint to make america great again it contains 9 billion in cuts to education and forecloses on the federal governments longstanding commitment to reduce educational inequalities the budget would take a meat cleaver to public schools and children with the greatest needs would suffer the greatest harm trump and education secretary betsy devos plan to slash programs that help lowincome childrenlike afterschool and summer programs classsize reduction efforts mentoring for earlycareer teachers child nutrition programs and community schools trumps budget director said the administration went looking for the most wasteful most indefensible programs in order to increase defense spending and build the infamous wall apparently the wealthiest cabinet in us history considers meals on wheels for seniors and programs to alleviate child hunger to be wasteful half of all children in americas public schools live in poverty rather than make a specious claim that the budget blueprint protects the nations most vulnerable populations devos should have fought for the programs that would actually do that for example in mcdowell county wva formerly coal country and now the seventhpoorest county in the nation 900 children could lose afterschool programs that provide tutoring technology health care counseling recreational activities and for some children their only reliable meal of the day parentslike irma castanon whose son juan attends the afterschool program at hart elementary school in austin texas while she is at workhave peace of mind knowing their children are safe supported and engaged after school and kids like juan can experience things that irma says all children should be able to like being on a soccer team joining boy or girl scouts and getting help with homework more than 80 house of representatives membersincluding trump supportersand nearly 1500 organizations are calling on congress to maintain federal funding for afterschool programs trumps budget proposal also targets funding for community learning centers like the community health academy of the heights in new york city that wrap services for children and families around the school chah offers a fullservice health clinic mental health services free eyeglasses for students who need them a parent resource center and a food pantry far from wasteful these resources are lifechanging as nearly all of the schools 650 students live below the poverty line aside from the obvious benefits to their wellbeing chah students are making the grade the number of students reading at the lowest level fell by 37 percent between 2013 and 2016 dozens of other communities have taken similar approaches with similar results compare this with school voucher programs which get a windfall in the budget despite reams of research showing their ineffectiveness the louisiana voucher program has led to large reductions in kids reading and math scores even a study by a provoucher group the fordham institute found that students in ohios voucher program did worse than children in public schools the proposal also targets initiatives that help teachers teach in toledo ohio for example teachers receive training in an intensive reading program for students who are not reading proficiently by third gradewhich research shows puts them at greatly increased risk of not graduating from high school classes that have implemented the program have shown a 50 percent increase in reading proficiency escambia county fla could lose a peer mentoring and assistance program that pairs accomplished teachers with firstyear and struggling teachers in addition to improving teaching quality the high level of support has been an effective recruiting tool all this is on the chopping block devos often says she wants parents to have more choices ask parents what they want and most often you will hear they want things like a school that is safe with wellprepared teachers and class sizes small enough that their child can get personal attention a school that meets children where they are and helps them thrive the trumpdevos budget does just the opposite indeed it seems intended to do what devos did in michigan defund and destabilize public schools so parents feel the need to look elsewhere i have invited the education secretary to visit public schools with me so she can see that they are far from being a dead end as she called them but rather are foundational to our communities and our democracy that is as true in deepblue places as it is in places that are ruby redlike van wert ohio the rural district we will visit next week van werts public schools focus on childrens wellbeing engage in projectbased learning and anchor the community theylike so many othersneed federal investment in these programs not a budget that takes a hatchet to public schools which

social spring is here which means warm weather antsy children and another school vacation when the fun and relaxing times end returning to school can be quite overwhelming last week a parent asked me after my therapy session with her child for advice on how to survive the upcoming spring break she said that winter break had disrupted her childs routine when it was time to return to school her child was unmotivated to do his morning routine did not want to complete his homework and lost ground in math which resulted in her needing to hire a tutor to review concepts researchers call this phenomenon the summer slide but it can happen in any season when children spend about a week or more away from school they tend to forget some of what they have learned this means teachers have to spend time reviewing old concepts rather than introducing new material during school vacations children fall out of their study routines and can even lose their ability to focus research shows that kids with disabilities like the kids i work with and those from lowincome homes are particularly prone to the slide the reason is that they have limited access to what we educators call supplemental learning opportunities like trips to local museums the library and the zoo yearround schooling helps in some ways but even that schedule includes extended breaks throughout the year that are on average two to three weeks long this is why we should think about shortening school vacations altogether and instituting an extended yearround calendar an extended yearround school calendar would increase the number of classroom hours by limiting school breaks to one week or less at a time that might sound extreme but consider that us children spend less time in school than most european kids and a month less than children in south korea im not arguing against all time off children do need a break from school to spend time with family observe holiday traditions travel and to just simply rest however this should occur for limited amount of days to prevent kids from falling behind academically in the meantime here are some tips for parents facing school vacations of any length keep similar routines this may be easier said then done however keeping your wakeup and bedtimes similar and filling the day hours with activities will provide your child a predictable structured environment a sense of stability and decreased stress by reducing the amount of unstructured free time your child will be less restless and bored keep the children busy find educational activities to engage in daily this will limit the amount of time they are home watching tv texting or playing video games some resources to find community activities are your local parks and recreation department local newspaper local libraries you can also do this at home with board games arts and crafts academic tasks meal preparation and reading have a daily visual schedule the whole idea of school break may be confusing for the younger children since they are still developing the concept of time utilizing a visual schedule helps them understand the what when where and why of their day its also important to involve them by letting them choose what activities they would like to do and cross off completed activities and days before they go to bed within your daily schedule you can include a countdown as to how many days your child returns to school this will assist your child getting mentally prepared for the transition back to school read to your child children are exposed to literacy concepts many times throughout their school day continuing to expose them to books while they are home will only increase their language development listening and comprehension skills reading to your child also stimulates their imagination and facilitates a positive interaction where they receive oneonone attention from the parent research recommends that parents set a side a scheduled time each day to read to their child raisingreadersnet limit electronics allowing a child unlimited access to tv and computer can lead to childhood obesity lethargy difficulty in school and insomnia the american academy of pediatrics recommends that children be limited to 1 to 2 hours of educational programming daily here are some ways to limit your childs access to electronics first keep them out of reach and out of your childs bedroom have your child earn their time with electronics upon completion of other activities specifically allocate times within the day that are appropriate for your child

environment do the social costs of some coalfired power plants exceed their values a new report from the environmental integrity project eip suggests that for a number of us coal plants their social costs as a result of premature deaths exceed the value of the electricity they generate in the report the group examined the coalfired plants with the largest emissions of sulfur dioxide in 2010 and 2011 that do not yet have plans to install or upgrade scrubbers and estimated the number of premature deaths from each plant and the cost of these deaths the calculations were performed according to the eip using a peerreviewed approach consistent with epa methods the report emphasizes the value of seeking cleaner and more efficient methods of electricity generation coal helped to power americas industrial revolution and electricity is obviously vital to our economy today but we have better choices now than we had more than forty years ago when most of these plants were built investments in advanced emission controls can greatly reduce the dangerous buildup of fine particles and investments in renewable energy and efficiency improvements can secure our supply of electricity and generate the jobs we need without the death and disease that are the price we pay for dirty coal plants an epa hearing on coal in frankfort kentucky this week prompted demonstrations from hundreds of coal miners and environmentalists miners protested the epas hold on 36 permits for coal mines in the state while environmentalists supported the epas decision to delay the permits because of concerns relating to water pollution we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again seattles city council unanimously adopted a resolution last month opposing plans to develop coalexport terminals in washington state according to the associated press if all the facilities are built at least 100 million tons of coal a year could be carried in trains through the northwest before being shipped to asia below find the 10 us coal power plants with the highest social costs that exceed their electricity value read the full report here

health coffee and naps are two things that people enjoy for many reasons but their usefulness in elevating productivity levels make them particularly enticing considering the stimulant components of caffeine pairing them together doesnt seem like it would be a great idea but believe it or not there is a school of thought that says drinking coffee and then taking a nap can when done right give people the boost they need to conquer the day heres how a coffee nap works drink a cup of coffee like you normally would then instead of getting back to business take a quick snooze it may sound counterintuitive but the caffeine wont actually kick in for about 30 minutes which also happens to be the perfect length of an effective power nap both sleeping and caffeine block the brains receptors of adenosine which is the chemical that causes drowsiness while a nap on its own can leave a person feeling refreshed the introduction of coffee beforehand can make for an even more effective energy boost there have been several small studies to support the theory behind a coffee nap one which was published in 1997 in the journal psychophysiology found that when adults ingested 200 mg of caffeine about 2 cups of coffee and then took a nap they performed better overall on a subsequent simulated driving test than those who just took a regular nap without caffeine another study from 2003 published in the journal clinical physiology compared the alerting effects of bright lights face washing and caffeine after naps caffeine came out above the rest as the most effective revitalizer after a nap despite the scientific evidence however a coffee nap isnt necessarily a guaranteed dose of focus and energy for one the time a person chooses to take one can influence its efficacy the lowest point of our circadian rhythm is in the afternoon says dr suzanne stevens sleep specialist at the university of kansas if the nap can be timed just right you can have hours of being more productive after the coffee nap a coffee nap regimen also comes with a few possible drawbacks for example if a person struggles with insomnia naps and caffeine might be the worst thing to add to a daily routine caffeine and afternoon naps may result in increased difficulty falling asleep at night they can also increase nighttime anxiety california therapist elika kormeili said over email moreover caffeine on its own can cause side effects in some people including general anxiety restlessness irregular heartbeat insomnia acid reflux and other gastrointestinal issues those having a particular sensitivity to caffeine should therefore probably steer clear of coffee naps finally even those who can handle caffeine and might benefit from coffee naps could do it incorrectly and render the nap ineffective some might not ingest the right milligrams of caffeine with the coffee and not benefit from the coffee nap or even find it hard to fully wake up if not enough caffeine is ingested stevens says just because youre drinking coffee doesnt always mean youre getting a sufficient dose of caffeine theres also the risk of oversleeping if a person sleeps for longer than 30 minutes the chances of falling into a deeper sleep increase and it becomes much harder to wake up even with the caffeine but when timed and dosed right coffee naps can help a person wake up more refreshed than a typical nap they can also turbo boost the caffeine a person ingests that means instead of having five or six cups of coffee in a day you may only need to have one or two to keep you on the productivity train whats more caffeine before a nap may also help a person stay alert for longer periods of time without a proper rest one study from 1994 published in the journal ergonomics looked at the cognitive ability of 24 men who only took short naps in a 24hour period half of whom drank coffee before each nap those who drank coffee with their naps scored roughly the same on their cognitive tests as they did the day before when they had been normally rested while the other half scored noticeably worse we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone

days stevens explains thats something from which almost everyone can benefit

politics police said thursday that they have connected the dna of a county official to the recent murder of investigative journalist jeff german whose coverage of alleged misconduct ultimately contributed to the official losing his primary election this summer at a news conference clark county sheriff joe lombardo said that clark county public administrator robert telles was arrested at his las vegas home and booked wednesday night on a charge of murder with a deadly weapon the 45yearold democrat was taken out of his home on a stretcher with what police said were selfinflicted wounds that were not lifethreatening telles 45 is accused of stabbing the las vegas reviewjournal reporter to death police said that they found germans body on saturday morning outside of the reporters house and that he was likely killed friday morning this has been an unusual case from the beginning the murder of an investigative journalist and the main suspect an elected official here in clark county lombardo said this is a terrible and jarring homicide one that has deeply impacted las vegas every murder is tragic but the killing of a journalist is particularly troublesome dori koren captain of the las vegas metropolitan polices homicide division said that a man was documented on surveillance images walking toward germans home on friday and then to the side of his house the man was wearing a straw hat a bright orange longsleeved shirt and gray sneakers and was carrying a duffel bag when german exited his house through the garage door and went to the side of the house the intruder got into an altercation with him and the journalist was stabbed multiple times police identified a vehicle seen driving around germans neighborhood on the morning of the murder prior to the murder and at the time of the murder koren also said that the man described by police had fled in that vehicle a maroon gmc yukon denali suv with chrome handles a sunroof and a luggage rack telles became a person of interest because of his publicly expressed hatred toward the 69yearold journalist and because a vehicle matching the description of the killers car was parked in front of his home video evidence showed the car leaving telles home the morning of the homicide and arriving back shortly after the estimated time of the death police say they discovered telles was driving the car that morning when law enforcement searched telles home vehicles and body they said they found a pair of shoes matching the killers clothing splattered with blood and cut likely in a manner to destroy evidence police also said they recovered a straw hat matching the description cut in a similar manner 23 telles was taken into custody on september 7 2022 and is currently at the clark county detention center he has been charged with open murder with a deadly weapon click below for previously released photos of the suspect and vehicle pictwittercomcgnw1xlf8d one of the most important aspects of this investigation was waiting on the dna results and we received positive dna results that showed robert telles dna at the crime scene koren said lombardo said that police have not yet recovered a weapon but that the investigation is still active telles voluntarily was interviewed by police and chose not to retain a lawyer according to the las vegas police department he is being held at the clark county detention center jeff was a loving and loyal brother uncle and friend who devoted his life to his work exposing wrongdoing in las vegas and beyond were shocked saddened and angry about his death germans family said in a statement obtained thursday by the reviewjournal jeff was committed to seeking justice for others and would appreciate the hard work by local police and journalists in pursuing his killer we look forward to seeing justice done in this case the statement said we also want to thank everyone for the outpouring of love support and recognition for jeff and his lifes work german was a tenacious reporter who covered crime courts government corruption and mob figures for decades in las vegas the journalist had launched a monthslong investigation this year into telles office which included allegations of abuses and an inappropriate relationship with an employee germans investigation into the potential wrongdoing led to public outrage by telles who regularly tweeted his anger at the reporter after a series of stories on telles the official lost his reelection bid in the june primary according to police telles was likely also upset that german was conducting additional reporting on the official the journalist recently filed public records requests for emails and texts between telles and three other county officials one of whom was identified in previous stories as the employee telles allegedly had a relationship with according to the reviewjournal the death of jeff german was both shocking and tragic and we join with our community in being stunned at how this situation has continued to evolve over the last few days county spokesperson stacey welling said in a statement clark county continues to cooperate with the lvmpd on this active investigation our condolences are with jeff germans family friends and colleagues at the reviewjournal the county said it is reviewing its options under the law regarding telles position as the public administrator which is an elected office the county has suspended telles access to county offices and property for the safety of our county employees and the public and said that employees of the administrators office are working remotely while the office remains closed until a determination is made about when it can open when county management was made aware of the personnel issues at the public administrators office a couple of months ago the decision was made to no longer have staff in the public administrators office report to mr telles and this solution will be in place until the public elects a new public administrator in november welling said lombardo said thursday that it was an inappropriate venue to speculate or opine on whether germans death is part of a nationwide

worldnews my story calls for stripping qatar of world cup suggests gulf crisis at a stalemate was based on a reuters story that ran sunday morning at 0359 london time i sent an email to the author of the reuters story early sunday morning asking for confirmation but never received a reply i decided to go with my analysis after the reuters story had been picked up by major news organizations and websites across the globe reuters withdrew the story 16 hours later saying the website on which the story was based said it did not publish the information attributed to it while the assertion based on the reuters story that the saudiuaeled alliance had written a letter to world soccer body fifa appears to be false my analysis of where the gulf crisis and how fifa is handling it stands nonetheless i apologize for the mistake and any inconvenience a saudiuaeled alliance has tabled a longexpected demand that world soccer body fifa strip qatar of its 2022 world cup hosting rights with little chance of fifa acting on the demand any time soon the move suggests that the alliance struggling to figure a way forward amid mounting international pressure for a facesaving way out of the sixweekold gulf crisis needs to be seen to be acting on its hitherto unfulfilled promise to tighten the screws on qatar amid mounting international pressure for a negotiated solution to the crisis and calls for the lifting of the alliances diplomatic and economic boycott of qatar saudi arabia and its allies have so far shied away from promises to tighten the noose around qatars neck if it failed to cave in to their demands centred on accusations of qatari funding of terrorism six weeks into the boycott qatar has been able to absorb the boycott which involves a cutoff of almost all land sea and air links with the gulf state it also has succeeded in standing its ground in a struggle for the moral high ground with its detractors whose demands have failed to garner a groundswell of international support while few in the international community give qatar a clean bill of health on funding of militancy and political violence many suggest that its detractors are tainted by the same brush the alliance has moreover struggled to come up with a set of demands that many in the international community have said need to be reasonable and actionable the saudiuaeled alliance initially put forward a set of 13 nonnegotiable demands that included cutting ties to a host of islamist and militant groups and individuals closing a turkish military base in qatar lowering its relations with iran shuttering qatarsponsored media such as the controversial al jazeera television network and putting qatar under guardianship qatars rejection of the demands and the alliances realization that its quest was being perceived by many in the international community as an attempt to undermine qatari sovereignty and curb freedom of the media prompted the alliance to adopt six principles that repackaged the demands and removed some of the sharp edges much like the original demands those principles also failed to garner the kind of international support the alliance needs to push forward with a tightening of the screws on qatar the alliance also appears to have backed down on at least one of its demands the shuttering of al jazeera in an interview with the times uae minister for the federal national council noura alkaabi said the emirates sought fundamental change and restructuring rather than closure of al jazeera the saudiuaeled alliance accuses the network of being a platform for militant groups we need a diplomatic solution we are not looking for an escalation ms alkaabi said suggesting that the saudiuae led alliance was looking for a facesaving end to a crisis in which parties have dug in their heels reducing margins for a way out that would allow all to declare victory at the heart of the gulf crisis lies a fundamental divide in how qatar and its main detractors saudi arabia and the uae envision the future of the middle east and north africa central to the dispute is the international communitys inability to define what constitutes terrorism and who is a terrorist it is a difference that is likely to weaken the demand to deprive qatar of its world cup hosting rights it is also a difference that has given the gulf crisis apotblamingthekettle character while qatar sees the survival of its autocratic regime in the support of political change everywhere but at home in a nave belief that it can exempt itself saudi arabia and the uae opted for maintenance of the status quo ante by rolling back the achievements of the 2011 popular arab revolts that toppled the leaders of tunisia egypt libya and yemen a subtext to the struggle is the existential battle between saudi arabia and iran the epic struggle has led to a military coup in egypt that removed from office the countrys first and only democratically elected president sparked devastating civil wars in libya and syria aggravated conflict in iraq and prompted an illfated saudiled military intervention in yemen that brought the country to the edge of the abyss with efforts to mediate a way out of the crisis in full swing fifa has little incentive to act on a letter by six of its members saudi arabia the uae egypt bahrain yemen and mauritania demanding that qatar be deprived of its hosting rights because it is a base of terrorism speaking to a european news website the local fifa president gianni infantino said that the countries warned fifa of the risks threatening fan and player security in a country that is the base and the castle of terrorism mr infantino said the six countries had threatened to boycott the tournament should their request not be acted upon while the six countries are unlikely to be under the illusion that fifa will simply accept their demand tabling it allows the saudiuaeled alliance to assert that it is not backing down in the gulf crisis and is increasing pressure on qatar the alliance also hopes to exploit widespread criticism within the global soccer community of fifas 2010 decision to award qatar hosting rights nevertheless fifa is unlikely to want to take sides in the crisis or weigh in on the debate on definitions of terrorism struggling to shake off multiple scandals that have severely tarnished the world soccer bodys image fifa is also unlikely to take a decision in a dispute in which all parties are tainted moreover fifa is under no real pressure to act the qatar world cup is more than five years away the gulf crisis is certain to be resolved long before that one way or the other in the meantime the boycott does not stop qatar from moving ahead with construction of world cuprelated

science think of one of your favorite classes whats come to mind for some learning certain content is memorable for some the classroom environment can be remembered in detail working in groups the nature of discussion experiencing studentled learning for others a class that connects to future employment is important and maybe for some or possibly even many its a combination of these and other parts of a class but what about learning to fail that could seem like more of a nightmare than a pleasant and important remembrance of a class ive been teaching at davidson college for over a decade and increasingly i hope my students learn yes to fail i hope they pass my class but also that they learn to fail and grow by doing so do i facilitate uncomfortable frustrating courses in fact many students comment on how they enjoy the courses and approach how its important to understand what i mean by failing let me summarize this concept with the following image drawn by a studio artist and math student at davidson college the artists name is tife odumosu i see his drawing as a visual representation of one method to effective learning tife didnt sit down and immediately draw the perfect cartoon he started drawing and iterated into his more finalized sketch some strokes of his pencil improved his work and others did not is this failure i dont think so but taken in another context it could be seen as so i teach math where the odd problems often have answers in the back of the book life rarely comes outside such a class with answers in the back of the book you check your answers in the future with outcomes that result from your choice learning math shouldnt by marked by those occasions when someone gets a correct answer what about those times you must redo your work as you iterate in your work what might you learn about your tendencies how might you improve for the next time even if you do it incorrectly once again in fact in some areas of mathematics there is no right answer id like more people to trust their own ideas and learn to patiently make imperfect attempts as they observe their thoughts evolving to encourage this type of thinking im leading a massive open online course often called a mooc through davidsonx which is a partnership between davidson college and edx the course comes in two parts with part one launching in late february the topic is applications of linear algebra generally in the context of computer graphics or data mining lets see an application in graphics a pixel in a color image can be stored with three values representing the red blue and green intensities of the corresponding pixel each value ranges from 0 to 255 where 0 means no red and 255 means the full intensity of red in the corresponding pixel in the image simple enough now lets use equations for lines to alter an image remember y mx b where m is the slope and b is the yintercept of a line here x will be the red blue or green intensity in a pixel in an image then y will equal the new intensity choosing m and b and applying this to color intensities allows us to recolor an image with linear equations for example we might take m 1 and b 255 forming y x 255 this would turn a value of 255 full intensity of red to 0 no red in the corresponding intensity value of a pixel lets give the mona lisa a mathematical makeover we simply need equations for the red green and blue intensities in the image then well apply this to every pixel in the image and have your new image ill take new green pixel 075old green pixel 150 new blue pixel 05old blue pixel 200 is that what you expected i didnt know exactly what to expect i had a certain idea but also simply had to run the program to see like tife drawing his cartoon i simply tried and saw what i got then i adjusted my attempts learning from what id done and iterating to what i wanted at times my iterations were based on mathematical calculations other times i mathematically doodled in a sense with numbers so soon my mooc will launch and well see what participants from around the world do with this and other similar exercises for those ready to explore the ideas offline and outside a mooc there is also my book when life is linear from computer graphics to bracketology it covers related topics to close ill share what i tell my students with increasing frequency each year look not only for where you succeed but where you believe that you didnt it is here that you can learn how you learn how you achieve and what challenges you you can learn to trust your thoughts for this i share a paraphrasing of albert einsteins article education for independent thought this quote appears in the oneman play walking lightly a portrait of albert einstein by len barron the purpose of education is to nurture thoughtfulness the lesser function of thinking is to solve problems and puzzles the essential purpose is to decide for oneself what is of genuine value in life and then to find the courage to take your own thoughts seriously in our education we should learn to stand in the unknown and wait for what you dont know will the answer come often but not always will the image match your expectations if not try again and see what you learn when you simply dont know stand there for it is when you stand not knowing that the answer may come here i share words by william s burroughs your mind will answer most questions if you learn to relax and wait for the answer and yes i want students to try and make attempts and learn from them for this i share a quote by thomas j watson former

health a classic arcade game could help adults with lazy eye according to a small new study researchers from mcgill university found that tetris a puzzletype game invented in 1984 that involves matching falling blocks could help train the eyes of people with adult amblyopia the scientific name for lazy eye amblyopia occurs when the central vision in one eye isnt developed properly and can lead to having crossed eyes or near or farsightedness according to the american optometric association researchers noted that current remedies for treating lazy eye involve covering one eye in order to make the other eye work harder but this method doesnt always work the new study published in the journal current biology involved 18 adults all of whom had lazy eye researchers had half of the study participants play tetris with just one eye the stronger eye was patched the other half of the participants played the game with both eyes unpatched but they wore goggles so that one eye was allowed to see only the falling objects and the other eye was allowed to see only the ground plane objects study researcher dr robert hess the director of the research department of opthalmology at the university and the research institute of the mcgill university health centre said in a statement forcing the eyes to work together we believed would improve vision in the lazy eye the study participants played the tetris game for two weeks after which researchers found that the study participants who used the goggles to play the game had better depth perception and improved vision of the weaker eye meanwhile the participants who covered up their stronger eye with the patch only experienced some vision improvement but when researchers had these study participants also try the goggles out they experienced improved vision and depth perception this isnt the first time video games have been fingered as possible lazy eye therapies research published last year in the journal optometry and vision science showed the potential use of specially designed video games to provide visual training for people with lazy eye

technology san francisco reuters internet security experts are calling for a campaign to rewrite web security in the wake of disclosures that the us national security agency has developed the capability to break encryption protecting millions of sites but they acknowledged the task wont be easy in part because internet security has relied heavily on brilliant government scientists who now appear suspect to many leading technologists said they felt betrayed that the nsa which has contributed to some important security standards was trying to ensure they stayed weak enough that the agency could break them some said they were stunned that the government would value its monitoring ability so much that it was willing to reduce everyones security we had the assumption that they could use their capacity to make weak standards but that would make everyone in the us insecure said johns hopkins cryptography professor matthew green we thought they would never be crazy enough to shoot out the ground they were standing on and now were not so sure the head of the volunteer group in charge of the internets fundamental technology rules told reuters on saturday that the panel will intensify its work to add encryption to basic web traffic and to strengthen the socalled secure sockets layer which guards banking email and other pages beginning with https this is one instance of the dangers that we face in the networked age said jari arkko an ericsson scientist who chairs the internet engineering task force we have to respond to the new threats other experts likewise responded sharply to media reports based on documents from former nsa contractor edward snowden showing the nsa has manipulated standards documents provided to the guardian the new york times and others by snowden and published on thursday show that the agency worked to insert vulnerabilities in commercial encryption gear covertly influence other designs to allow for future entry and weaken industrywide standards to the agencys benefit in combination with other techniques those efforts led the nsa to claim internally that it had the ability to access many forms of internet traffic that had been widely believed to be secure including at least some virtual private networks which set up secure tunnels on the internet and the broad security level of the secure sockets layer web used for online banking and the like the office of the director of national intelligence said friday that the nsa would not be doing its job if it did not try to counter the use of encryption by such adversaries as terrorists cybercriminals human traffickers and others green and others said a great number of security protocols needed to be written from scratch without government help vint cerf author of the some of the core internet protocols said that he didnt know whether the nsa had truly wreaked much damage underscoring the uncertainty in the new reports about what use the nsa has made of its abilities there has long been a tension between the mission to conduct surveillance and the mission to protect communication and that tension resolved some time ago in favor of protection at least for american communications cerf said yet cerfs employer google inc confirmed it is racing to encrypt data flowing between its data centers a process that was ramped up after snowdens documents began coming to light in june author bruce schneier one of the most admired figures in modern cryptography wrote in a guardian column that the nsa has undermined a fundamental social contract and that engineers elsewhere had a moral duty to take back the internet but all those interviewed warned that rewriting web security would be extremely difficult mike belshe a former google engineer who has spearheaded the ietf drive to encrypt regular web traffic said that his plan had been watered down in the committee process during the past few years as some companies looked after their own interests more than users another problem is the relatively small number of mathematical experts working outside the nsa a lot of our foundational technologies for securing the net have come through the government said researcher dan kaminsky famed for finding a critical flaw in the way users are steered to the website they seek they have the best minds in the country but their advice is now suspect finally governments around the world including democracies are asserting more authority over the internet in some cases forbidding the use of virtual private networks as much as i want to say this is a technology problem we can address if the nation states decide security isnt something were allowed to have then were in trouble kaminsky said if security is outlawed only outlaws will have security

economy weight watchers employees were busier than ever these past few months as the coronavirus pandemic heightened eating issues for many people from those locked down at home obsessing over what to eat to essential workers turning to food for comfort and to soothe anxieties a doctor who spent her days tending to covid19 patients many of whom died was among those who talked with erica stein until recently stein age 50 was working online chat shifts for weight watchers or ww as it now calls itself the company offers a 247 online support feature for paying members at the end of the day she reached for a pint of ice cream and potato chips stein said and the doctor whos on the front lines of a pandemic said this extremely relatable eating episode made her feel like a failure a heartbreaking notion familiar to all of us who rate ourselves on how good our eating has been instead of well any other metric i said oh my gosh youre not a failure dont be so hard on yourself show yourself some kindness stein recalled the doctor thanked her for the support i felt like i was doing something worthwhile stein said not anymore weight watchers unceremoniously dumped stein and many others last week in audioonly zoom calls that lasted mere minutes employees logged on and listened to a manager read from a script their voices were muted so they couldnt ask questions they were told not to talk about it with anyone some of those nowformer weight watchers employees told huffpost when the call was over they were shut out of all ww employee websites and their emails were closed down by the weekend some of those who were laid off had worked decades for the company and had started out as members trying to lose weight themselves ww would not say how many employees were let go worldwide when asked about an anonymous post on thelayoffcom that claimed thousands were fired but the company reported to the federal government that it had 17000 employees a majority of whom are parttime as of december 2019 and last week it said in public filings that it would be cutting its workforce amid the pandemicdriven economic downturn and that it expected to spend 12 million in employee termination payments and related costs as the covid19 crisis has forced the closure of our physical studios around the world we have had to make some difficult decisions that have directly impacted the lives of some of our valued team members the company said in a statement provided to huffpost we thank them for all of their efforts on behalf of our members during their years of service the pandemic has accelerated the companys big plan to move more of its services online in an appeal to a younger demographic ww has 3000 studios around the country amid the current crisis it has taken the 30000 weekly workshops held there and put them online usa today reported it recently said it would start reopening some physical locations but many would not reopen ww declined to answer specific questions as to why it fired those who were already working remotely instead it told huffpost our digital transformation also includes the evolution of all our customer interfaces and coaching platforms and we are reorganizing as such huffpost talked to five former employees all women all 50 and over they said a number of their laidoff coworkers are also older they hail from a generation that didnt talk about selfcare or wellness or body positivity but like the companys iconic founder jean nidetch just wanted to look slim we are from the era when there were a lot of housewives who wanted to stay home and raise kids singleincome families said one former employee who is in her 60s from new jersey now women thank god have evolved to have careers no one young would stay there for that kind of money stein and other former employees said that they didnt think the layoffs were ageist they said some younger women had also been let go but stein did think the companys transition to digital has been hard for its most devoted members who she said have struggled as the company has switched its guidance from say tracking your food intake on paper to tracking it on your phone they were trying to be hiptrendy when their core group is senior citizens rather than adapt and have both they were shutting one out stein said they werent respecting the true loyal fan base and those are the people who love their weight watchers they wouldnt miss a meeting she said socially distant layoffs have become the thing to do during the pandemic scooter company bird laid off 400 employees in a twominute zoom chat that the companys ceo later said he regretted uber fired 3700 workers via zoom earlier this month the coldly remote firing method is leaving people reeling at an already stressful time the weight watchers employees told huffpost they were devastated by the way the layoffs were handled for these women working at weight watchers was less a job than a mission theyd all started out as members trying to lose weight theyd managed to reach their goal weight and stayed around to help others do the same there were bumps along the way several mentioned the challenge of maintaining your weight while going through menopause the idea that the company would let them go en masse in just minutes they said was like being abandoned by a spouse or betrayed by a best friend i started the program really hard in 2014 i was 285 pounds and decided it was time said nancy a 51yearold former employee on long island before then shed been going to meetings but kind of floundering she said then i really dove into it i was active in my meetings and became really good friends with members and they were all like you need to be a leader it became my goal nancy asked that huffpost not publish her last name for fear of retaliation from the company which still owes her another paycheck every pound i lost was another round closer to working with weight watchers she said thats why this is so emotional for me they took that away i worked so hard for it not getting to say goodbye to members also really hurt she said one of the women she worked with had died of covid19 the womans sister called to let her know i was the first person she called nancy said she contrasted that with the way the company handled the firings here i am being told youre expendable stein who lives in manhattan has depressive disorder among other conditions the abrupt firing was a shock she said she cried for days afterward and scheduled an emergency appointment with her psychiatrist as someone who suffers from a mental illness to be fired like that felt very difficult for me she said working for the company parttime had been a sort of perfect job for someone with her health issues she started working for weight watchers about six years ago after losing more than 100 pounds she said the work got her out of the house to meetings around new york city stein did standalone meetings at ww properties and she went to other companies like nbc and google and worked with employees there who wanted to lose weight when the pandemic shut down inperson meetings stein started doing customer service for ww online during a time of such uncertainty in the city she said the one thing in my life that stayed the same was i still had my work in recent years especially since oprah winfrey bought a stake in the business in 2017 weight watchers has tried to rebrand itself as being less about body image and more about wellness that made the layoffs even more galling they came just two days before the start of an online event with oprah about how people can find clarity in both your physical and emotional wellbeing during these challenging times empathy was one of the most crucial principles that weight watchers taught its coaches said nicolle nordman age 53 who worked for the company for 18 years it was literally drilled into our heads empathy empathy empathy no matter what the members problem is if they call in angry you are so empathetic that by the time youre done with the call youre their best friend they fired us in the least empathetic way possible she said nordman joined weight watchers as a member in 2001 and wound up losing 55 pounds they asked her to start working the meetings acting as a coach to others following the program at the time she was home with her four kids the oldest had cystic fibrosis the work was flexible and parttime ideal for her situation the pay was terrible as a parttime coach she made about 25 per meeting which could amount to about 4 an hour nordman told huffpost and the pay hadnt risen in many years former workers said nordman switched to working online about seven years ago once her kids were out of the house she managed to turn it into a fulltime job the pay was still low nordman earned 14 an hour a little more than the minimum wage where she lives doing online support and meetings she made about 500 a week unemployment will pay 278 a week the layoff means she doesnt have health insurance anymore for herself or her son whos in college she doesnt know what shell do ive been doing this for 18 years nordman said i dont know where i can combine something that helps people like this with a flexible schedule that i have former employees are still worried about their weight ive seen a lot of people come and go and every single person i know thats left has gained all of their weight back and more said joanne patten a 59yearold houston resident whod been with the company for nearly 11 years after the layoff call last week maintaining her weight is now her biggest worry she said we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly

social john oliver has won us over again this season after having a challenging and welldone interview with the infamous edward snowden on his popular hbo show last week tonight with john oliver as an avid viewer of his show i can honestly say that i have gained more knowledge of the world in his half hour comedy than a weeks worth of watching programs on bbc or cnn its pretty clear that comedy is a useful source to inform citizens on delicate issues his program also makes it clear that american citizens are very uninformed compared to other nations when it comes to domestic and foreign politics this is already common knowledge to many americans but olivers program on april 5th made one thing obvious to viewers and that is we have a very limited knowledge about the internet this is particularly the concern that oliver was questioning in his interview with snowden other than the proven weakness of the media of this issue and snowdens reckless management of these dangerous nsa documents americans are scarcely uneducated of this matter if snowden really wants us to solve our surveillance issue in america then we must have a conversation that americans are capable of having just as oliver suggested the first step to having this conversation is to increase our knowledge of the internet and the technological concepts needed to understand in this discussion by june 1st congress will renew our current government surveillance program unless we have this debate to reform it this cant happen though if we arent educated from the concepts used in the language of the patriot act or the documents that snowden wants revealed of the nsa oliver demonstrated several times that americans are ignorant and gullible towards politics of the internet and the internet in general however one observation in the interview that caught my attention was after oliver asked snowden if the american people have the capability of having a conversation on government surveillance as soon as snowden started explaining the complex nature of the internet oliver quickly interrupted and jokingly responded that this explanation is equivalent to when an office worker sees the it guy come in to the office he quoted dont teach me anything i dont want to learn which inherently characterized the american reaction towards learning the technology behind the internet this led to snowden accepting this truth as he peered away from olivers face and stated he was sympathetic to the problem its evident that we need to have a basic understanding of the internet and the engineering behind it i myself am a victim of this ignorance and i am sure you the readers are stricken to this as well we admit this and we also take this for granted in a 2014 pew survey they found that americans have an alarmingly low basic knowledge of the internet they tested over 1000 participants with diverse backgrounds and found that only 23 percent of people were aware of the difference between the internet and the world wide web as they are same thing other data they found was that 34 percent of the surveyors actual knew what moores law is which is about the number of transistors that can be on a smartphone in addition 44 percent responded true when asked if private policy means company keeps users info confidential these are technical facts that you think so little about that you didnt even notice i lied about all of them the facts are that the internet and the world wide web are not the same thing that moores law is actually about the number of transistors in a computer chip and not in a smartphone and private policy does not necessarily mean that companies keep the information they collect on users now i hope ive kept your attention and realize the importance of why we need to learn this information the internet has become part of our lifestyle and we seriously need to know how it works before someone with disagreeable intentions will use it against us this is not entirely our fault for having this low skill set as its purely a systemic one most people receive basic training from schools but our public education system has yet to fully stress the importance of including computer science as a core curriculum as a student who received his whole education from new york state a state with a supposedly succeeding education system i have not attained any sort of technical training this is not because i or any other students werent interested in acquiring this knowledge but our administrators neither offered these classes to begin with nor stressed the importance of graduating with these courses as we were overloaded with the basic liberal arts classes such math science history etc to learn skills in information technology one must either teach themselves the expertise take a class outside of school or wait until college to learn however waiting until college may not be the best solution as we enter college with a higher liberal arts background than in technical training which means a student who wants to learn programming must start with zero preparation and potentially struggle throughout the courses also postponing your desire to take classes in computer science in college might also be a problem if your university prohibits you from taking these courses unless you are majoring in that degree or are in the engineering school this is a troubling aspect in our american education system where we are doing a poor job at preparing our youth in this sector while focusing on liberal arts is definitely important to teach our children john olivers uncovering of americans illinformed comprehension of the internet proves we need to place computer science at the same core level as math science history and reading especially since we learn and are given assignments from those latter subjects on our computers if we dont do so now then we will have some government agency make us sacrifice our values as edward snowden mentioned and potentially watch over us like big brother

technology former secretary of state hillary clinton may have focused on middleclass wages in a sweeping economic policy speech monday but her comments on the gig economy are drawing fire as republicans seek to bolster their tech credibility get ready for an uber election with ubers allies in the press and political world pillorying the critics of the ondemand economy as analog dinosaurs stuck in the 20th century where past election cycles featured hype about the ways social media could transform democracy and washington uber and the ondemand economy that it symbolizes frame consequential complex economic and labor policy issues that dont fall along calcified ideological lines unsurprisingly these topics are already being politicized in a presidential election season where over a dozen different republican candidates are jostling to break through in the technology press which tends towards boosterism when it comes to startups and tech companies writers like gregory ferenstein suggested that clinton better offer specifics about uber and airbnb or be branded an enemy of innovation clinton shouldnt have demonized startups she should have called for a new classification of contract worker now she seems antibusiness obviously no one wants to be an enemy of innovation in the united states in 2015 least of all a politician hillaryclintons ideas about uber and lyft are out of touch we need more innovation not less so how did clinton demonize startups and rebuff the sharing economy she mentioned startups once in her entire speech posing an open question about how to help them grow outside of northern california in another section she praised the burgeoning gig economy sector but cautioned that its growth raises some questions meanwhile many americans are making extra money renting out a small room designing websites selling products they design themselves at home or even driving their own car this ondemand or socalled gig economy is creating exciting economies and unleashing innovation but it is also raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future later on clinton signaled an intent to crack down on bosses who exploit employees by misclassifying them as contractors or even steal their wages thats the portion of the speech that led wired to warn clinton is coming after the gig economy those two statements are the sum total of clintons critique of the sharing economy which has received growing criticism in the press over the past year if clinton had wanted to take on uber over bad behavior she could have easily done so citing past mistakes she didnt writing for fusion kevin roose says clinton has a lot to lose by talking about the sharing economy in anything but glowing terms because wherever uber has failed it has decidedly not failed to paint its principled opponents or anyone who would question its march to ubiquity really as backward nostalgic neoluddites sure clinton might pick up some populist support by going after uber but you can almost hear the attack ads now is hillary clinton beholden to taxi industry thugs does she support drunk driving to oppose uber in 2016 is to enter a rhetorical playing field that has been boobytrapped there are legitimate reasons to be wary of ubers rise but few if any national figures have been able to oppose the company without being made to sound like regressive fogies and until skeptics of the gig economy find new and better ways to articulate their concerns it might be better for clinton to make a play for less flammable ground the challenge is that uber and the growth of ondemand startups do frame a discussion worth having as noam scheiber explored in the new york times the gig economy is just an evolutionary descendent of a generationslong trend towards a significant portion of the american workforce earning income from contingent employment around 53 million people are temping freelancing or contracting with hundreds of millions more around the world likely to participate in the years to come thats the trend that clintons chief technology officer former google product manager stephanie hannon responded to in post on medium yesterday weve seen some employers take advantage of vulnerable workers in industries like construction janitorial services agriculture and even home healthcare hillarys remarks today challenge us all to think about the future of work in america shes calling on all sectors to do better to ensure that no employees are exploited and to ensure that all workers are rewarded for their work the vast majority of my colleagues in the technology community support these goals its essential that we talk about how to do that right later in the speech clinton asked questions that relate to this changed context without decrying it how do we respond to technological change in a way that creates more good jobs than it displaces or destroys can we sustain a boom in advanced manufacturing what are the best ways to nurture startups outside the successful corridors like silicon valley shes not alone in drawing attention to these issues influential venture capitalist fred wilson whose investments include ondemand startups and talent marketplaces agreed with clinton in a post on the gig economy that this is a discussion worth having my view on these comments is that hillary is right these companies are creating exciting new economies and unleashing innovation and she is also right that these companies raise questions about work place protections and what a good job will look like in the future we should not be afraid of this discussion we should embrace it and have it albert wenger wilsons partner at union square ventures agreed that the nation needs to talk about these issues in a blog post he suggested framing the conversation not simply around jobs but in the context of a universal basic income where a government provides a single payment to all of its citizens as long as we frame the debate in terms of workplace protections and a good job we are still caught in the industrial system the hallmark of the industrial system is what i call the job loop most people sell their time and receive a wage in return they then use that wage to buy products and services which in turn are made by people selling their time this job loop has been extraordinarily successful in combination with relatively free markets it has given us incredible progress but it is now breaking down due to automation and globalization the rise of the gig economy is a part of this break down of the job loop instead of trying to fix it and to imprint traditional work and labor thinking on these new platforms i propose an entirely different approach truly and deeply empower individuals to participate on their own terms its unlikely that this congress will seriously consider a universal basic income that said that policy suggestion along with proposals for negative income tax or flexible benefits like workers compensation and unemployment insurance that arent dependent on any employer shouldnt be beyond the boundary of debate wilson posed other hard questions about ondemand startups and the gig economy that legislators regulators judges and governors may not be thinking about but probably should be can you be a freelance worker if you dont own the data about your work and earnings history and be able to take it with you when you leave a platform or export it to a third party for optimization can you be a freelance worker if you are indentured to your employer because they loaned you the money to purchase the asset you are using to earn your income i think the answer to both is obviously no but there are companies who argue that it is yes asking politicians where they stand on uber is probably inevitable in this upcoming election season heres hoping that more reporters on the campaign trail ask them where they stand on these kinds of specific policy questions helping the country to have the healthy democratic debate it needs to hash out better answers
environment chevron halts output after navy spots oil stains regulator anp allows chevron to stop production spill in november led to 111 billion civil suit recasts to add court decision production halt by guillermo parrabernal and jeb blount sao paulorio de janeiro march 17 reuters a brazilian court on saturday barred 17 executives from chevron and transocean from leaving brazil pending criminal charges related to a highprofile oil spill last november a federal judge in rio de janeiro state granted a request from prosecutors who are pressing for charges against both firms a spokesman for prosecutor eduardo oliveira said in a phone interview george buck who heads chevrons brazil unit and the other 16 executives must turn in their passports to the police within 24 hours the spokesman said charges are expected to be filed on tuesday or wednesday according to the prosecutors press office the court decision came a day after the brazilian navy spotted a thin stain of oil extending for about 06 mile 1 km in offshore field frade which was also the site of last years spill usbased chevron said in a statement it halted production at frade on saturday after winning permission from brazilian oil industry regulator anp neither chevron nor any of its executives have been formally notified of any action by the judiciary yet the company statement said any legal decision will be abided by the company and its employees we will defend the company and its employees prosecutors want to press a criminal indictment of buck and other executives from chevron and swissbased offshore drilling company transocean three government sources told reuters in january transoceans rig was used in the frade field it is up to a judge to determine whether to accept the charges and proceed with indictments chevrons spill in november leaked as many as 3000 barrels from seafloor cracks it resulted in an 11 billion civil lawsuit the largest environmental damages case in brazils history although the total amount of oil was less than 01 percent of the bp spill in 2010 in the gulf of mexico chevrons troubles in brazil could force it to rethink latin american strategies a shortage of trained workers engineers and equipment has driven up costs in brazil and chevron faces an 18 billion environmental verdict in ecuador chevron is stopping production plans to better assess its reservoir management plans in brazil where it has spent over 2 billion developing the largest foreignrun oil field the suspension will shut down a field with the capacity to produce 80000 barrels a day more than 3 percent of brazils oil output chevron which made public on thursday the request to suspend output at frade said the plan was supported by its partners in the field brazilian state oil company petrobras and frade japan which is owned by japans inpex japanese trading house sojitz and japanese state oil and metals group jogmec chevron owns 52 percent of frade and operates the field petrobras owns 30 percent and frade japan 18 percent the decision to request the temporary shutin of production is a precautionary measure chevron said in the statement the company will conduct a comprehensive technical study and prepare a complementary study to better understand the geological features of the area working with partners navy staff found the stain on friday after flying over the area off brazils atlantic coast according to a statement late on friday the navy the anp and environmental protection agency ibama will monitor and coordinate actions with chevron to control the stain the statement added most of the oil coming from the leak is being captured by specially built containment devices chevron said adding additional devices would be installed as needed chevron said on thursday there was no evidence that the new leak and the one in november were related natural oil leaks in the campos basin home to the frade field are common cleveland jones a geologist at ufrj the state university of rio de janeiro said in an interview until there is some proof there is a good chance that this leak is a natural occurrence not something to do with chevron

technology watching the speed of the technological revolution take the world often overwhelming every day it seems theres a new way to connect by new innovative social media tools and working with teenagers gives me a birds eye view of whats going on ive tried to avoid becoming the old guy who doesnt know whats going on but sometimes i feel myself slipping especially when a student asked me the other day you still email wow email i wonder if this kid had any idea how new relatively email is to humanity sure its no instagram video technology but when you think about it over the last two decades everything about communication has changed i wonder what they would think if someone actually took the time to write gasp a handwritten letter ive been watching waiting researching and studying teen behavior as a precursor to how business will be conducted in the future ive been seeing innovative students who are applying the ground breaking cultural revolution to their everyday friendships and ive often been more than a little concerned with all the access to communication are we really more connected sure we can blast a text message to our friends at any time knowing our voice will be heard without any notion of working through a problem yes we can facebook message tweet and even snapchat our favorite pictures to be discussed but do those thousands of friends actually help our plague of loneliness or have we just fallen desperately aware of how lonely we really are a friend recently shared an article with me at the npr blog that has piqued my interest a new company called digital detox is actually trying to enter the marketplace for those who have been so consumed with digital relationships they need a time out they have established retreats where people go to literally detox from all the technology around us one attendee actually was quoted as saying you read articles about being present and being in the moment and you kind of nod your head and you agree but i dont think you know what that means until you put everything away and youre ok with where you are says anastasia savvina who attended the june camp sure there are enormous benefits to the efficiency of being online but are the methods taking away from being able to have real conversations most of you know i run a teen retreat in the summertime and we actually do a program similar we take the iphones tablets and computers and lock them away in a safe for two weeks we ask the students to see how impactful it can be to develop stories with each other in the moment they bike hike raft rock climb and take time to develop skills to look each other in the eye they learn how to have conversations with one another where they have to negotiate body language deal with potential rejection and work through conflict resolution without the help of a text message or twitter feed and although its not central to our message its becoming more and more important the students beg me to keep technology away because they get a break from the pressure of feeling connected all the time it takes a couple of days but after two weeks without you cant even begin to imagine the changes in these students in terms of confidence self awareness and the ability to go out and start their own adventure void of feeling like they have to see what everyone else is doing on whatever timeline their watching ive asked thousands what their biggest fear is and the majority of students agree their biggest fear is being alone we all know social media is a revolution that isnt going to return to the days of the pony express but inside our social media use its important we dont forget the value of developing human relationships even todays most highprofile tech leaders are taking at least one

politics if donald trump runs for president a third time republicans on capitol hill will have to face all sorts of things they had hoped were gone forever constantly having to answer for his tweets worrying about being the target of his tweets and a return to the chaos parade that characterized his administration but theres another possible twist that so far at least most republicans in the senate dont even want to think about trump running and then getting indicted for his jan 6 conduct that would give the nation a modern political first a major party candidate with a realistic chance of winning the nomination while facing a felony criminal charge republican senators say that so far they have not given the idea much thought at least not that theyre willing to admit and declined to say if an indictment for breaking the law would be disqualifying for a person vying to be constitutionally charged with carrying out the nations laws youre talking about supposition wait till things happen and then well talk ok sen richard shelby of alabama told huffpost this week wow i dont know i dont know what the rules are said sen rob portman of ohio i just havent thought about it the possibility is not as farfetched as it might sound trump has seemingly all but announced plans to run again hinting broadly his supporters will be happy with his decision at the same time signs have emerged that the department of justice is further along than had been thought with its investigation of the jan 6 attempted insurrection and what role trump played in it on july 26 washington post reported that trump was being investigated for possible crimes related to jan 6 and cnn reported recently that trumps lawyers were in contact with the justice department about the probe and had warned trump he could be charged youre talking about supposition wait till things happen and then well talk ok trumps legal defense team has warned him that indictments are possible cnn said citing unspecified sources as for portmans question whether catching an indictment would be against the rules there is nothing in the republican partys official rules that mentions indictments or charges nor in the last party platform adopted in 2016 thats different from even the house republicans rules which explicitly say members of the party have to resign from their committee seats if indicted in other words an indictment could force a rankandfile house republican to resign from the thirdtier house budget committee but have no formal impact on who can run for the partys presidential nomination of gop senators who had an opinion on what should happen if trump runs as an indicted candidate the feelings ranged the full spectrum sen rick scott fla who heads the national republican senatorial campaign charged with winning back the chamber for the gop said the call whether to run was trumps this is a choice that president trump gets to make and that the voters get to decide he told huffpost sen rand paul ky a 2016 candidate for president said an indictment would just be akin to criminalizing political differences i think prosecuting someone for their political beliefs or stances is not appropriate in a democracy he said whether or not you think the governor should approve the electors or the secretary of state or the state legislature sounds like a political point of view sen lisa murkowski the alaska republican in a battle for reelection against a trumpendorsed opponent said talk of an indicted trump running was talking about scenarios way far down the road but asked if she thought an indictment would be disqualifying murkowski said sure floridas marco rubio another gop presidential candidate trump defeated in 2016 declined to comment saying im not doing any of that speculative stuff gop leaders were also quiet on the question senate minority leader mitch mcconnells ky office declined to comment though mcconnell has hinted in the past trump may be a nonissue for the gop because it will have a crowded field of potential 2024 nominees a request for comment with house republican leader kevin mccarthys office was not returned one former democratic presidential candidate did have an opinion though sen elizabeth warren mass one of the last of the 2020 democratic candidates to fall before president joe biden won the partys nomination said it shouldnt take a formal charge to bar trump we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for

science a poorly written dsm criteria set is useless the essential prerequisite to an accurate diagnosis is that different clinicians can agree on whether it is present or absent in a given individual if the definition lacks precision different people will interpret it in their own different and idiosyncratic ways the dsm5 definition of autistic spectrum disorder has two fatal technical flaws that make it impossible to interpret and use reliably a truncated version of its criterion a reads as follows a persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts as manifested by the following 1 deficits in socialemotional reciprocity 2 deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction 3 deficits in developing maintaining and understanding relationships the dsm 5 examples offered for each of these three items are vague enough to overlap into normality but i wouldnt have made a big fuss about this the really fatal flaw here is that no instructions are given as to whether one item two items or all three items must be present to make the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder the diagnosis will vary dramatically from rater to rater institution to institution and place to place depending on which of these three different possible convention is chosen it will be even more impossible than it is now to determine rates of autism and why they shift so much over time the second fatal flaw comes in the following statement attached to the end of the criteria set for autism spectrum disorder note individuals with a well established dsmiv diagnosis of autistic disorder aspergers disorder or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified should be given the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder individuals who have marked deficits in social communication but whose symptoms do not otherwise meet criteria for autism spectrum disorder should be evaluated for social communication disorder this throws wide open to raters the choice of using dsmiv criteria or dsm5 criteria depending on their personal preferences dsm5 has essentially made it clinicians choice how to define and diagnose autism spectrum disorder some will require one item from criterion a others two yet others three and some will chuck dsm5 altogether and use the very different definitions that are contained in dsmiv the diagnosis of autism is already badly muddled there has been a fortyfold increase in rates in just 20 years some of this is due to the introduction of aspergers in dsmiv some to improved case finding and reduced stigma but a significant portion comes from loose and inaccurate diagnosis dsm5 turns the current confusion into a complete babel the impossibly vague and confusing dsm5 definition of autism spectrum disorder is essentially useless for clinical or research purposes and is not a trustworthy guide for determining school services we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again how could this possibly happen sadly the inevitability of this kind of blooper was predictable and predicted criterion writing is a rare skill despite years of practice i am pretty bad at it and i have known only a handful of people who could really do it well the dsm5 work groups had little supervision and were given far too much freedom to write criteria their own way the result is an amateurish botch these egregious mistakes require immediate correction too much rides on the diagnosis of autism to let it ride on each clinicians random preferences allen frances is a professor emeritus at duke university and was the chairman of the dsmiv task force

science what do you think of this for my title up against the clock my sister asked me she was writing a book about womens decisions to have children perfect i exclaimed thats my life up at 5 am to grade papers get the kids off to school at 730 then i rush to the college to teach my 9am class and on and on to the unavoidable 4pm committee meeting and then home by 530 when the sitter has to leave but lets go on physicists and philosophers debate whether time exists yet we measure it anyway our 24hour day of 60minute hours evolved from timekeeping in ancient babylon the astronomer berossas described a solar clock in detail students in my class ancient inventions made the working model you see here chaldean sundial museum of ancient inventions photo by stan sherer the clocks mechanism is simplicity itself a hemispherical bowl with a pin set on an edge the bowls inner surface is incised with 12 arcs equally spaced apart at sunrise the shadow of the pin touches the western rim as the sun rises the shadow sweeps back across the arcs until it vanishes at noon then it lengthens on the other side until at sundown 12 oclock it reaches the eastern rim simple yes but you see the problem since each day has 12 equal hours their lengths vary with the season in new york city on june 21 2014 the summer solstice the sun will rise at 525 am and set at 831 pm eastern daylight time by our reckoning that babylonian day will be 15 hours 5 minutes and 39 seconds long dividing by 12 you get hours of 755 modern minutes their hours match ours only at the equinoxes bablylonian timekeeping persisted into the 20th century in a few places well come to one of them in a minute though mechanical clocks had long since spurred a transition to a sunsettosunset 24hour day in that equinoctial system the hours were equal night and day yearround better but still not perfect since the day began at sunset one days 0 oclock was not the nexts if you had a clock you had to reset it each evening our modern date and placeindependent midnighttomidnight system with greenwich prime meridian was agreed to by an international convention in 1884 but the changeover was slow explains avner wishnitzer who wrote his dissertation on ottoman timekeeping because the equinoctial system was deeply embedded in the culture have you given up inches and ounces the telegraph and railroad not the international decree eventually did equinoctials in yet sunsettosunset days are still observed in religious traditions the evenmoreprimitive 12hour babylonian solar day persisted into our era because it was embedded in culture too especially where the culture was agrarian farmers live by the natural rhythm of sunrise noon sunset the deficiencies of berossas clock so evident to us may have escaped its users i find a hint of this in a 1909 travel book high albania by the intrepid edith durham 18631944 the oldest child of a london surgeon durham followed the custom of her time and her class caring for her invalid widowed mother instead of marrying and raising a family of her own by middle age she was a stressedout wreck her sympathetic doctor prescribed travel durham set off not for fashionable watering holes but for the mysterious balkans in the decades before the great war she found her calling in the rugged isolated mountains of northern albania traveling by foot and horseback through this outpost of the crumbling ottoman empire she came to know admire and love a land that time forgot whose people still lived by an ancient code that dictated unconditional hospitality and unforgiving blood feuds alike curious lively intelligent and a good artist too durham noted customs dress and conversation she withheld judgment for the most part though later she would be accused of proalbanian bias but she found the rigid mealtimes one ancient custom too many strong coffee at sunrise dinner at high noon and supper after sunset the schedule never varied day in and day out winter spring summer fall the albanians have a custom cruel to those that are not to the manner born she complained sunset in turkish time is twelve oclock they therefore maintain nor could i ever convince them to the contrary that supper is always at the same hour all the year round as by their clock it was i did not enter into the fruitless argument about the sun setting late in summer she sighed because in albania it always sets at the same time twelve oclock in england maybe the sun sets later in the summer but with us never her albanian guide told her twenty years ago my husband and i retraced durhams footsteps literally in several places the great edith durham stayed in this very house we were told we found traces of durhams albania too our hosts were as kind and generous as hers had been and blood feuds had resumed after a 50year communistdecreed hiatus but time had remembered albania at last the mountaineers wore wristwatches today they skype with their emigrant children zade grishaj lepushe albania 1994 photo by stan sherer at solstice time i think of the many clocks we live by i told my sister like it really was but then again it wasnt really once once we were late

politics no one knows exactly when the next recession will happen but layoff victims will certainly fall into a safety net that is weaker than ever after congress turbocharged jobless benefits in response to the coronavirus pandemic lawmakers in three states have already slashed the statefunded benefits that are the foundation of the unemployment insurance system lawmakers at the federal level meanwhile have lost all appetite for improving the system even after the pandemic exposed its flaws on a national scale and its hard to imagine congress stepping in with another temporary expansion of benefits as republicans continue to blame high inflation on the extra benefits democrats approved last year weve seen incredible gridlock in congress to pass things that are overwhelmingly popular with the public like the 15 minimum wage rebecca dixon director of the national employment law project told huffpost i think we could get to a place where there is a crisis and congress cant get out of gridlock and address it in response to every recession since the 1950s congress has added additional weeks of benefits to the standard 26 provided by states after lawmakers temporarily added 73 weeks of benefits in the wake of the great recession republicans in 10 states permanently cut the duration of their underlying state programs the giveandtake pattern ramped up with the coronavirus pandemic congress added weeks of benefits in 2020 and also took the unprecedented steps of temporarily boosting the weekly value of benefits by 600 and expanding eligibility to include workers without traditional payroll jobs such as rideshare drivers republican governors in 25 states then took the unprecedented step of rejecting extra federal benefits in 2021 state legislatures in 10 states also took up bills cutting benefits according to andrew stettner director of workforce policy at the century foundation a progressive think tank there was some bad activity last session and we expect some of these states will come back for more stettner said in an email only iowa kentucky and oklahoma permanently cut benefits in the last legislative session kentuckys new law also imposed stricter work search requirements iowas requires unemployment recipients to accept jobs at lower wages iowa republican state representative michael bousselot said the safety net should be less of a safety net and more of a trampoline that bounces layoff victims back into jobs what we are proposing to do is to refocus unemployment on reemployment rather than just being a safety net bousselot said in march republicans at the state and federal levels blamed extra benefits for causing a worker shortage in 2021 but businesses have continued to complain of worker shortages long after the supplemental benefits disappeared one of the most important changes congress made in 2020 allowed the selfemployed and independent contractors such as uber drivers to apply for benefits for the first time in the history of the statefederal unemployment insurance system the pandemic unemployment assistance program paid workers who were ineligible for regular unemployment because they didnt have a history of payroll earnings on file with their state government a bloomberg investigation showed that in the first year of the pandemic black workers in georgia were more likely than their white counterparts to be denied regular benefits the special pandemic benefits helped close some of the gap in benefits coverage but the program might be better known for fraud than for reducing racial disparities its so hard to bring attention to this program when theres not a crisis progressive democrats want to reform the unemployment system so that it covers nontraditional workers reduces variation among states and stops states from slashing benefits and they want to upgrade outofdate information technology used by many state workforce agencies some workers had to wait several months for benefits due to the strain an unprecedented surge in claims put on antiquated state systems but democrats omitted the proposals even from the most expansive version of the domestic policy bill they wound up whittling down and passing last month as the inflation reduction act theres no hope of its return in the immediate future dixon said it would likely take another crisis to create a window of opportunity for congress its so hard to bring attention to this program when theres not a crisis she said many economists expect a recession and widespread job losses sometime in the next year as the federal reserve raises interest rates in order to tame inflation by slowing the overall economy job growth has remained strong but there are potential warning signs matt darling an employment policy fellow at the niskanen center a centerright think tank has pointed to widening gaps between the unemployment rates for collegeeducated workers and those with no higher education as well as between white workers and black workers two of the numbers i track closely are the gaps between college and noncollege educated workers and the gap between black and white workers both are sharply up right now which is concerning beyondthenumbers httpstconxdd9uxhhx pictwittercomwndliaessy if we are seeing the effects of the federal reserves rate hikes these are the places wed expect to see them first darling said in

that the widening gaps represent noise in the data but it could be that layoffs have begun to increase for the more vulnerable members of the american workforce dixon said she didnt think a recession caused by interest rate hikes would be as bad as the one caused by the pandemic or the one caused by the financial crisis more than a decade earlier but she does expect a familiar pattern in who gets hurt the most i dont know that therell necessarily be widespread pain from the recession if we have one in the near term but there will be pain she said and the people who experience the most pain are also the ones who are most likely to be locked out of the ui system
sports fans of the boston celtics showed on sunday that they may be more forgiving about ray allens offseason departure than some of his former teammates in his first return to boston since joining the miami heat allen was honored with a video tribute and eventually a warm welcome before allen and the heat took on the rondoless celtics on sunday a tribute video to allen was played at td garden although the celtics fans initially greeted the teams former star with a smattering of boos the video of highlights from allens fiveyear stint with the celtics changed the tone by the time it was over the 37yearold was being hailed with a standing ovation later when allen first checked into the game late in the first quarter those cheers quickly turned back to boos allen who helped the celtics win a championship in 2008 left boston on notsogood terms last summer despite boston trying to trade him to memphis last april before the trade deadline the organization still offered him a twoyear deal worth 12 million even though the amount was double the salary of miamis offer allen decided to take his talents to south beach i dont know what to expect from their side allen said ahead of the game but its an interesting concept because ive always gotten a warm welcome even before i started playing there i just want to win everything else will take care of itself we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again when the celtics took on the heat in miami in the first game of the season kevin garnett snubbed allen and refused to acknowledge him in any way as hard as it was for celtics fans to do the same thing during the tribute video they couldnt help but eventually cheer
environment this week brought several big headlines in extreme weather news check out photos of the weeks extreme weather from around the world
health we are never alone if you would please hold that thought politics it seems at least the variety practiced and prevailing in the us nowadays endeavors to make morons of us all it gives us a contrived reality where there is no middle ground between the nanny who wants to tell us all what to have for breakfast and the ninny who actually believes that big corporations wont exploit us in a world of no regulation or oversight it implies to us that if ever we acknowledge the strength in unity if ever we ask for or offer a hand up we must be cardcarrying members of the karl marx fan club anybody that concedes some value to the body politic is labeled a socialist what a load of festering rubbish and as fate would have it festering rubbish holds the key to our enlightenment on these muddled topics by and large its bacteria that cause rubbish or anything to fester sometimes its other kinds of microorganisms but lets not split cilia bacteria will do bacteria or their cousins the archaea were almost certainly the first life form on the planet they are our distant ancestors and astonishing but true they differ more from one another than all other forms of life differ from each other or from them bacteria are the incubator of biodiversity on our planet there is more fundamental genetic variation among varieties of bacteria than there is separating penguin from pine tree orange from ocelot i kid you not but i do digress lets get back to politics or rather the body politic we are one even when were alone we are in fact never alone within our own skin we are sufficiently in the minority to qualify as a potential rounding error bacteria outnumber our cells by 10 to 1 at least the total population of the socalled microbiome totals roughly 90 trillion these germs and although they are a vital part of us they are in fact germs contribute to a wide array of critical body functions their importance has turned them into new age media stars as well with coverage even alist celebrities might envy these bugs are big news long known though ever better studied is the profound contribution of intestinal organisms to digestion there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that disruptions to the normal flora of our gi tract may be implicated in a wide array of gastrointestinal disorders and may be of particular importance in irritable bowel syndrome there is a corresponding body of evidence fast growing that replenishing normal flora with probiotic supplements may confer benefit in such circumstances there is growing recognition that disruptions in gastrointestinal flora may be a factor or in unusual but not truly rare cases of weight loss resistance perhaps even the factor conspiring to cause obesity there is some early evidence that reconstituting healthy intestinal flora through the easy expediency of probiotic supplements or the more dramatic and perhaps regrettably if aptly named fecal transplant may be quite helpful under such circumstances and there is growing awareness as well that our resident microbes influence almost every aspect of our physiology from hormonal balance to metabolic rate to immune system function and inflammation i believe these bugs tell us more about ourselves than how inescapably germy we are in his characteristically articulate compelling and wellresearched book outliers malcolm gladwell builds a new podium for john donnes timehonored admonition no man is an island gladwell demonstrates that the very examples of selfmade people our society most reveres are in fact products of both aptitude and opportunity circumstance and communal support neither triumph nor disaster is ever wholly owned by just one individual as with all of my ostensible sojourns into the tangents of philosophy this one leads reliably back to my day job the salient public health threats of our time are a wide array of social and environmental factors that in the aggregate contrive to make obesity diabetes and other chronic disease epidemic lifestyle factors that each of us potentially controls every day constitute the master levers of medical destiny exerting greater influence on years in life and life in years than anything else but these lifestyle factors are in turn much influenced by the modern environment in which we live and which collectively we devised against this backdrop we have gravitated to the poles of ideology some invoke personal responsibility as if lifting oneself up by the bootstraps is fully independent of all other influences including presumably the existence of a bootmaker others argue for environmental reform as if we are entirely helpless while waiting on the world to change a middle path would concede that we like to be autonomous and sometimes have the stuff to do so but often dont and are never entirely apart from the influence of others an approach informed by biology would see an opportunity for common ground somewhere between get there alone or die trying and running a hammer and sickle up the flagpole in the case of nutrition it is nonsense to pretend that parental or personal responsibility should suffice to overcome the clever and wellcompensated efforts of people trained in marketing and advertising but it is equally important to acknowledge that there are ways to confront the challenge of eating well in the modern world collaboratively ways that dont require higher authorities telling us what to have for breakfast the human body is quite simply unviable without the biological body politic with that as precedent and precautionary tale perhaps society can acknowledge the same exigency and accept that some challenges are best or even only addressed communally we would be in proud company to so concede john donne has told us so margaret mead has told us so malcolm gladwell has told us so hillary clinton has told us so whoever said in unity there is strength told us so and perhaps most irrefutably dr seuss has told us so i tell you so as well and these are the words i prefer the best defense of the human body resides often with the body politic i am quite prepared to defend my autonomy when i decide to ride my horse or see the avengers or read plato i am deciding i disavow any need to hold a referendum on the matter for my resident bacteria but maybe our inner reality can help us cool off the overcooked rhetoric on which our society seems so inclined to feed like it or not we are all social give or take the ist biologically we are codependent on a whole population of other organisms we cannot survive on our own even within our own skins i concede that without my resident microbes i would die indeed i concede that without them i could never have lived autonomy matters personal responsibility matters we often can and as often should take matters of moment into our own hands we often can and as often should be masters of our fate and captains of our souls but we should nonetheless acknowledge that the best defenses of the human body reside largely and often inextricably with the body politic public health is for the public and is best advanced by the collective efforts of the public in society as in our own skin from gladwells outliers of sociology to the gastrointestinal microbes of biology we are never ever alone dr david l katz wwwdavidkatzmdcom

technology security issues with intel corp microchips are only slowing computers slightly technology companies said as researchers played down the need for mass hardware replacements to protect millions of devices from hackers google and other security researchers this week disclosed two major chip flaws one called meltdown affecting only intel corp chips and one called spectre affecting nearly all computer chips made in the last decade that raised the prospect of intel being on the hook for lawsuits claiming that software patches to fix the issue would slow computers and effectively force consumers to buy new hardware driving the companys shares down but intel said in a statement after us stock markets closed on thursday that the performance impact of the recent security updates should not be significant and would be mitigated over time it said apple inc amazoncom inc google and microsoft corp had all reported little to no performance impact from security patches intel continues to believe that the performance impact of these updates is highly workloaddependent and for the average computer user should not be significant it said the company confirmed that the flaws reported by the researchers could allow hackers to steal information from computers phones and other devices but insisted that the issue was not a design flaw the chipmaker said it would require users to download a patch and update their operating system to fix the issue microsoft and google have said they expect few performance problems for most of their cloud computing customers apple said in a separate statement late on thursday that its tests showed patches would not significantly affect processing speeds our testing with public benchmarks has shown that the changes in the december 2017 updates resulted in no measurable reduction in the performance of macos and ios or in common web browsing benchmarks the californiabased firm said cert the cyber security project at carnegie mellon university sponsored by the us government on friday withdrew its recommendation for the replacement of the central processing units cpus of affected systems in the updated guidance cert said operating system and some application updates mitigate these attacks daniel gruss the 31yearold information security researcher and postdoctoral fellow at austrias graz technical university who discovered the meltdown flaw welcomed intels white paper on the issue this looks much more professional now gruss said in comments emailed to reuters on the change in recommendation from cert gruss said however that there were no replacements yet that could address the flaws in processors that he and other researchers have found all cpus are affected also very recent ones gruss said furthermore software updates can fix most of the problems leaving only a small remaining attack surface browser makers google microsoft corp and mozilla corps firefox confirmed to reuters on thursday that the patches they currently have in place do not protect ios users with safari and virtually all other popular browsers not patched hundreds of millions of iphone and ipad users may not have secure means of web browsing until apple issues its patch apple said it would release a patch for the safari web browser on its devices within days it said that there were no known instances of hackers taking advantage of the flaw to date we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again writing by abinaya vijayaraghavan editing by amrutha gayathri and patrick graham
science in may 2013 the mathematician yitang zhang launched what has proven to be a banner year and a half for the study of prime numbers those numbers that arent divisible by any smaller number except 1 zhang of the university of new hampshire showed for the first time that even though primes get increasingly rare as you go further out along the number line you will never stop finding pairs of primes that are a bounded distance apart within 70 million he proved dozens of mathematicians then put their heads together to improve on zhangs 70 million bound bringing it down to 246 within striking range of the celebrated twin primes conjecture which posits that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by only 2 now mathematicians have made the first substantial progress in 76 years on the reverse question how far apart can consecutive primes be

entertainment this article is part of huffposts reclaim campaign an ongoing project spotlighting the worlds waste crisis and how we can begin to solve it are there any side effects associated with ugly produce sometimes fruit and vegetables grow in such a funny way that they seem to take on their own personalities or just look totally nsfw sadly these unique foodstuffs are often discarded at various points along the supply chain solely due to their appearance some grocery stores are making inroads into selling the socalled ugly veg but more need to follow suit with that in mind weve

technology hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this week in apple rumors our regular look back at all of the weeks unconfirmed gossip questionably sourced reports and blatant speculation about future apple products from around the web lets take a look back at what the various apple blogs and websites were excited about in the past week from march 28 check out our previous edition of apple rumors here and for all the latest you can follow me on twitter right here last week we reported on shady rumors that the nextgeneration iphone would be released this summer this week as a sort of tribute to the movie groundhog day we are reporting onshady rumors that the iphone 5s will be released this summer watch out for that first step its a doozy yes we had two rather prominent apple pundits both predict this week that the next iphone will land in the summertime following the previous weeks report from barclay analyst kirk yang targeting the summer as the season of the iphone 5s the predictions this time around at least come from two prognosticators with solid nighsterling reputations kgi securities analyst mingchi kuo and apple blog imores rene ritchie lets slap on our speedos and dive in well start with kuo who shot to fame in the apple pundit community with his call two years ago that apple would release only the iphone 4s and not a redesigned iphone 5 in 2011 since then hes earned respect as one of the few accurate forecasters of apples release schedule when kuo publishes research people read that note and they dont roll their eyes as they might with other analysts on monday kuo released a research note concerning the next iphone actually next iphones kuo thinks apple will release an iphone 5s and a cheaper iphone aimed at emerging markets more on that in a second the iphone 5s will be released in july kuo writes and will differentiate itself from the iphone 5 in five ways 1 faster processor 2 better camerabetter flash 3 fingerprint sensor under the home button for security reasons read here for why we think the fingerprint sensor is coming 4 thinnerlighter 5 different name kuo also writes that apple will also release its longgestating cheaper iphone in july which will have the same basic dimensions as the iphone 5s but will have a slightly weaker camera a slightly heavier weight and will be available in colors that are not black and white heres kuos full chart comparing the iphone 5s the lowcost iphone and the current iphone which kuo was kind enough to email to us that the new iphone will come out in july is just like kuos opinion man because an equally wellsourced apple pundit is calling for a different month its a prediction off weve got a prediction off 2 or on the contrary mesdames et messieurs will the iphone 5s come out in august rene ritchie the proprietor of and chief writer for apple blog imore has also built up a certain amount of credibility lately hes been the first to accurately call the dates of a couple different apple product unveilings a day after kuos prediction of a july iphone debut ritchie blasted out a post claiming hed heard the iphone would come out in august still beachbaseballbbq season but a month later eid al fitr not independence day its a short post but ritchies looking at an august release date for the next iphone which he says and stop me if this sounds familiar will have a faster processor and improved camera he does warn that things can and do change but for now he thinks apple is targeting august what should we glean from the dueling projections of july and august from two titans of apple punditry while its too early to choose one month or the other i do think its becoming clear that barring some sort of calamity the next iphone is indeed on track for a summer release that exact date and month will become clearer as the snow melts and leaves blossom and we all start taking our banana hammocks out of storage but if youre trying to decide between upgrading your smartphone now or attempting to wait for the next iphone you can use that julyaugust target as a general timeframe 3 could we see the new ipad before the new iphone if you read the imore post above and you should because you have a thirst for knowledge then you know that it is short but contains two nuggets 1 the iphone 5s is scheduled for august 2 the new ipads the ipad 5 and ipad mini 2 are scheduled for april yes april as in the month that is after this one ritchie writes that hes been told an aprilish launch is getting serious consideration for the nextgeneration ipads but that hes really not sure what to make of that yet now this comes with several caveats that aprilish doesnt necessarily mean april that getting serious consideration doesnt mean that its going to happen and that not sure what to make of that yet means no one really knows whats going to happen if youre a regular reader of this column and you likely are because you have a thirst for knowledge you might remember that the estimable jeremy horwitz of ilounge wrote earlier this year that march had been the target release for the new ipads but that apple decided to push it back mingchi kuo too thinks that we wont see the new ipads until after summer we were just introduced to the ipad mini and the fourthgeneration ipad remember in october and apple has tended to space out its product launches by a year the one outlier to that pattern of course was octobers ipad which arrived just 8 months after the previous ipad had phew no one knows anything or if someone does know something we dont know which someone that is the new ipads could arrive in a month or in two months or in six months at this point none of those scenarios would surprise anyone i wouldnt think the timetable it appears is much less clearcut than the one for the iphone its freaky freaky stuff and speaking of general freakiness the iwatch oh you didnt think we were going to make it through a week in apple rumors without some news on that apple wristwatch did you if you did give yourself a spanking because you were wrong heres the latest 4 apple certainly seems like its planning to release this iwatch thing by the end of 2013 we close with the iwatch which scored two prominent rumors this week both claiming that apple is attempting to get its latest product category out on shelves by christmastime this year as you may recall very little actual substance has been reported thus far we know that apple has a fairly large team working on its wristwatch and that it is targeting 2013 as its release year bloomberg who had previously reported that apple had over 100 iwatch staffers on board chimed in with another article this week though the majority of the article was speculative analyst gobbledegook it did contain this paragraph about what those staffers might actually be doing features under consideration include letting users make calls see the identity of incoming callers and check map coordinates said one of the people who asked not to be identified because the plans arent public it would also house a pedometer for counting steps and sensors for monitoring healthrelated data such as heart rates this person said technology site the verge chimed in later in the day reporting that apple wants its watch to run a full version of the ios operating system which runs on your iphone and ipad and that it would like for its watch to be able to last four to five days without a charge both the verge and bloombergs sources say apple is really trying to have this thing out there by the end of 2013 in time for christmas and in time to compete with google glass barring some sort of change its looking more and more likely that the iwatch will become a reality apple fans who were hoping for a pair of iglasses instead of an wristwatch it seems will have to settle for duct taping the iwatch to their face it appears i for one am looking forward to wearing both my iwatch and my google glass out in public and seeing how long i can go without getting the crap kicked out of me for being the nerdiest man in the universe please dont take my battlestar galactica fanny pack its a collectors item thats all for this week in apple rumors please join us again next week for more or if you cant wait a week you can always get the latest apple rumors by following me on twitter right here

social on the coldest morning new york city has seen this winter a stream of teenage students hit a bottleneck at the front of a brooklyn school building they shed their jackets gloves and belts shivering as they wait to pass through a metal detector and send their backpacks through an xray machine school safety agents stand nearby poised to step in if the alarm bleats its an everyday occurrence for more than 100000 middle and high school students across the city on this morning as on every school day senior justin feldeo prepares to be pulled aside for separate screening by a hand wand feldeo is studying to be a firefighter and the boots he wears for class trigger the metal detectors fifteen minutes after the formal start of the school day students are still pouring in even later for having to go through the machines almost as many new york city students run the gauntlet of xray machines each day as pass through the scanners at busy miami international airport and the procedure is numbingly similar students must remove belts shoes and sometimes bobby pins as the wait stretches as long as an hour a propublica survey found that the daily ritual is borne disproportionately by students of color black and hispanic students in high school are nearly three times more likely to walk through a metal detector than their white counterparts nearly 21 years after a fearful city installed them at the front doors of more than 80 schools there are growing questions about whether the security precautions do more harm than good today by propublica and wnycs count students at more than 236 new york city schools are required to pass through metal detectors there are a lot of things that are done in the name of student safety that dont view the students as the people who need to be protected but view the students as the people somebody else needs to be protected from said jill bloomberg principal of park slope collegiate a secondary school with 423 students in grades 6 through 12 she is trying to get the scanners removed from her building in brooklyn the metal detectors were first installed in the early 1990s when crime rates were much higher and have stayed in place even as crime in the public schools has fallen 48 percent over the past 10 years crime in schools in the last year alone has fallen 11 percent according to the new york police department since 1998 only two permanent metal detectors have been removed and their necessity appears almost never reevaluated the scanners have remained after the schools in which they were installed shut down and entirely new schools opened in the same buildings and while some principals say the security measures provide a critical line of defense at schools with particularly volatile mixes of students few believe more than 200 new york city schools still meet this bar black and hispanic students in high school are nearly three times more likely to walk through a metal detector than their white counterparts in a report called security with dignity a task force created by new york mayor bill de blasio recommended last july that the city remove some metal detectors the nypd agreed to study the issue but has provided no timeline and nearly six months later the department of education has yet to publicize criteria for removing them a spokeswoman for the department of education would not comment on a plan for removing the metal detectors we will continue to ensure students are in safe environments where they can learn and succeed said toya holness a deputy press secretary the recommendations have faced stiff opposition from the union which represents the new york city school districts over 5000 safety agents who are technically part of the nypd security with dignity said greg floyd the head of teamsters local 237 i dont know how you have the two in the same sentence floyd said the metal detectors are working as an effective deterrent and warned that the task force should be wary about cheering their removal in this case they better very well hope they work because if they dont then they all have problems he said and floyd brushed aside the complaints that the scanners are used primarily in schools serving lowincome black and hispanic students children from those neighborhoods he said often require them would i say put metal detectors in brooklyn tech i would not floyd said because the students there some from affluent neighborhoods are committed to learning theyre not committed to fighting thats not the case in every new york city public school and you cant say treat the children the same because we dont do that despite the widespread use of the scanners the amount of contraband found is low in the approximately three million scans conducted in the first two months of this school year only a tiny number of contraband items were discovered according to a nypd document obtained by propublica among the 126 possible weapons seized at schools that scan daily some found hidden on school grounds others by scanners were an unloaded handgun 73 knives 21 boxcutters three bb guns and an assortment of loose bullets and razor blades some school officials believe the daily security checks actually lead to behavior problems among the students until recently tyler brewster was a dean of discipline and a math teacher at the school for democracy and leadership in brooklyn which has metal detectors she now works at the james baldwin high school in manhattan which does not brewster said she doesnt believe students at either school should be forced to go through the scanners and that it brands whole groups of students as untrustworthy we didnt have to go through the metal detectors as teachers and im no less or more human than our students why do you trust me to have a bad day and handle it the right way versus the kid having the bad day brewster said i wonder how much of the tone is set by having metal detectors in the first place in the approximately three million scans conducted in the first two months of this school year only a tiny number of contraband items were discovered kamaya sanders a student at the secondary school for journalism in brooklyn said that she sometimes felt suspicious of her fellow students as they stood in line to get checked sometimes you want to say your schools safe but you have the metal detectors so you never know then lets say someone in front of you gets stopped then youre like oh they may have something you get scared sanders said it does make you feel safe in a way but sometimes its not worth it at democracy and leadership brewster said the scanning led to daily altercations some of which have ended with arrests there were maybe 3000 students in my building and every single person had to be scanned she said on rainy days the kids were gonna have to wait in line in some cases they had to take their shoes off but the floors were wet so then there would be an argument between the safety agents about not taking their shoes off and then not being allowed into the building and then that would escalate the dilemma of the scanners is on display at a massive brick building in the heart of park slope in brooklyn the building which takes up an entire city block once housed a single high school john jay with a tumultuous reputation now four new schools share the building one of the schools park slope collegiate would like to remove the metal detectors the others dont bloomberg collegiates principal said the neighborhood which is now filled with trendy shops and restaurants has changed significantly and that fights or weapons in the building are now rare for reasons the nypd did not explain the john jay campus was not among the school sites listed as having a metal detector so it was unclear if any weapons had been recovered from the building in the first two months of the school year the metal detectors send a message to the students that we dont trust you and even if we trusted you we dont necessarily trust the guy behind you that message she said runs counter to what her school is trying to teach and its alienating bloomberg said she has been against the metal detectors since she became principal at the school a dozen years ago she said her colleagues the principals at the other schools are worried that something could happen if the metal detectors are removed its very hard to have a rational conversation when youre talking about the possibility of something happening bloomberg said they make a lot of people feel safe it doesnt mean they make them safe and it doesnt mean that theyve considered what they give up the story of how new york city came to install metal detectors at middle and high schools across the city traces to a february morning in 1992 it wasnt even 10 am before two students were shot to death at thomas jefferson high school in the east new york section of brooklyn by the afternoon a third teen had died after accidentally shooting himself in his house that day everything that could have gone wrong did thenmayor david dinkins had been scheduled to address the jefferson students as a preventive measure after a separate shooting at the school killed a 16yearold boy two months earlier after that shooting the school began performing security scans on students with handheld devices but on the day of the mayors visit principal carol burtbeck called off the scans convinced they would send the wrong message to students fifteen security guards and police officers were present in the school that morning gunfire erupted just a few feet away from them the city was quick to respond the board of education approved a 20million plan to install metal detectors xrays and electromagnetic doors at an additional 40 schools vastly expanding a program that had involved just 16 schools usually large and in the most crimeridden areas of the city in the years that followed the installation of metal detectors became the answer to every new slashing or stabbing twenty more schools added them in 1993 bringing the total to 81 the rise in serious incidents at the citys schools in the 1990s ran counter to the citys dropping crime rate over the 1991 school year 3193 weapons were confiscated in public schools 189 of them firearms the following year violent incidents in schools rose 16 percent to 5761 dinkins up for reelection against rudy giuliani who was campaigning on a tough on crime platform put police officers in all of the citys then 1069 schools where they have remained ever since over the next three years the city steadily added metal detectors to its schools by 2003 88 middle schools and high schools had them some of these schools have since been replaced by multiple smaller schools yet the scanners remain thus far none of these schools has removed the metal detectors outright and the current plan includes a gradual reduction in use nypd assistant chief brian conroy of the school safety division said the police can reduce scanning in a school to three or two days then even further to random scanning one bronx building called jhs 113 richard r green that houses four middle schools has already reduced its scanning so far without ill effects according to an assistant principal at one of the schools the chancellor came to the building in the fall and noticed it was a pretty calm place said dr marvin jennings assistant principal at the forward school kids were in classrooms teachers were teaching learning was happening it added to the feeling and sentiment that daily scanning was not necessary and could be scaled back the forward school is emerging from a rocky past since 2012 it has been labelled a persistently dangerous school by state officials and has had four different principals in five years but jennings said the environment has improved and that kids feel safer in the school even with less scanning the nypd data obtained by propublica notes only two items found on site during the first two months of the school year a knife and a tool found in a flowerpot outside the school for jennings what matters most is the students mindset as they go through the detectors it wont be the first time they get scanned it wont be the first time that someone looks at them in a way thats less than complimentary because of race gender or ethnicity he said helping them learn how to cope with that and seeing themselves as bigger than the opinion of another man or woman is what i think gets them through one of the few school buildings that has managed to remove the scanners the former eastern district high school in brooklyn did so by enlisting students in the effort to quell violence in 2006 the high school was on its way to be shut down and replaced by three smaller schools in the same building the three new principals joined forces with elected local officials parents and persuaded the board of education to remove the machines we came in as wideeyed idealistic newbies and we wanted to change things said william jusino principal of progress high school one of the schools that moved into the building eastern district he said used to have such a bad reputation as a dumping ground for difficult children and staff that local shops would close down when school got out only to reopen later we wanted to make sure that we avoided that jusino said that we didnt grow into that type of situation jusino and the other principals took a stance that the metal detectors had to go even though everyone was never 100 percent sure it was a good idea district officials gave the new schools their chance to rethink school safety for the first two years jusino recalled students were reminded on a daily basis they were being trusted to not bring in weapons into the schools weve been on high alert ever since jusino said youve gotta make sure that there isnt a serious incident god forbid and how could you make sure how could you guarantee that you really cant what you could do is invest in your children the most serious challenge to the scannerless approach came last january when two progress high school students were shot in connection with gang activity a few blocks from the school deans ushered kids inside and popup metal detectors were stationed in the building folks were genuinely afraid and anxious and i understood it im anxious every day jusino said recalling a emergency staff meeting at which several faculty members expressed their desire to have metal detectors back but the answer is not the machines the answers the relationships the answers giving kids options in the school weapons will get into the building without metal detectors weapons will get into a building with metal detectors jusino said the idea is what do you do what programs do you do whats the trust and values you have in your school this story was originally copublished by propublica and wnyc

environment vlissingenoost the netherlands on this windswept peninsula near the belgian border the trees grow shrubby and the dune grasses bow horizontally before the north seas gusts but along the coast industrial spires rise vertically defying nature and creating a skyline of steeples to the rival faiths in this countrys energy future ivorycolored wind turbines bristle from flat meadows gray smokestacks reach skyward from an oil refinerys bramble of metal pipes steel pylons tower over the saltsprayed landscape fringing the twolane road with a garland of highvoltage power lines yet for half a century the steadiest emissionfree energy here has come from inside what looks like a stubby dulllooking grain silo thats the borssele nuclear power station the only fullscale commercial reactor the dutch ever built opened in 1973 the complex machine for capturing the energy from split uranium atoms was the second reactor built in the country and it provides about 3 of the netherlands electricity its relatively small compared to other plants of the time as it was originally planned as the first of six in this area but that was back in fission electricitys midcentury glory days before chernobyl and fukushima transformed from farflung place names into synonyms for catastrophe that compelled many nations to abandon their atomic ambitions and embrace fossil fuels the borssele reactors lonely 49 years may soon come to an end if the plant were 100 miles east in germany or a mere 10 miles south in belgium that would almost certainly mean that the reactor despite currently having regulatory permits to operate for at least 12 more years was shutting down early but unlike its two closest neighbors which have rapidly decommissioned their own nuclear stations while squeamishly burning more gas and coal the netherlands plans to build at least two new reactors in the coming years the dutch governments proposal which names this site as one of three potential locations for the nations next reactors represents a rare bet on traditional nuclear power at a time when more countries are closing existing plants than opening new ones nuclear power is by far the most efficient source of electricity thanks to stringent regulations around the world its also among the safest flight crews on highaltitude airline routes are on average exposed to about five times more radiation than workers at nuclear plants no country has completed a permanent disposal facility for radioactive waste yet but several such sites are underway and regardless there is a relatively small amount of spent fuel in the world most deaths involving nuclear energy stem from construction accidents even after combining the two infamous disasters in ukraine and japan with every worker known to have died mining or milling uranium the total deaths linked to nuclear power over the past 80 years rank just above wind and solar when compared to the volume of energy produced by contrast just the fine air pollution from burning fossil fuel is responsible for 1 in 5 premature deaths worldwide each year harvard university scientists found last year and thats not counting industrial accidents or the everwidening toll of climate change for decades visions of mushroom clouds scenes of homer simpson in the nuclear control room and images of radiationblistered skin have made the improbable seem inevitable but with planetheating emissions soaring oncerare floods droughts and heatwaves are compounding to make the biblical look literal and the dutch struggling to meet their climate goals may finally be ready to invest seriously in nuclear energy again fission reactions are complex molecular events a neutron slams into a larger atom splitting its nucleus into two smaller nuclei and releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the form of heat and radiation after first discovering the phenomenon in 1934 physicist enrico fermi having fled fascist italy with his jewish wife carried out the first controlled fission reaction at a university of chicago laboratory in 1942 shortly thereafter the us government newly embroiled in world war ii recruited fermi to join the manhattan project on aug 6 1945 the destructive power of fission reactions made its debut to the world when the enola gay a us bomber dropped a 9700pound uranium atomic bomb on hiroshima japan instantly killing tens of thousands of people and destroying 5 square miles of the city four years later on aug 27 1949 the soviet union successfully tested its first atomic bomb just as soon as this apocalyptic arms race had begun a separate competition would kick off on dec 20 1951 us government scientists produced electricity using heat from a nuclear fission reactor to run steam turbines at a national laboratory test site in idaho two years later on dec 8 1953 president dwight eisenhower delivered his famous atoms for peace speech in which he pitched nuclear power as a tool for abundant peacetime energy production on june 27 1954 the soviets connected a nuclear reactor about 70 miles southwest of moscow to a power grid for the first time on aug 26 1956 the british hooked calder hall 1 the first industrialscale commercial nuclear reactor in the world up to the grid in windscale england eisenhowers speech was wellreceived in the netherlands which held positive public exhibitions on nuclear power and began work on an experimental reactor laboratory in the late 1950s the suez crisis brought on by the war between israel and egypt had sent oil prices soaring increasing demand for an alternative energy source in the early 1960s the country started construction on a small pilotproject reactor about an hour southeast of utrecht the dodewaard nuclear plant was completed in 1968 without ever facing meaningful societal questioning let alone opposition according to an eindhoven university of technology report on the history of dutch nuclear energy just as the plant started producing electricity in 1969 workers broke ground on borssele a reactor 10 times larger on the coast in zeeland the netherlands westernmost and least populous province nuclear reactors offered bountiful energy and independence from the geopolitics of fossil fuels in a country with recent memories of hunger and military occupation but as cold war stockpiles expanded and weapon tests increased in frequency and payload opposition grew and nuclear power became a target by the time borssele came online the political landscape had changed with the launch of several new antinuclear groups that nascent movement gained steam in march 1979 when one of the valves that controlled the flow of coolant water to a reactor at the three mile island nuclear plant near harrisburg pennsylvania jammed causing the radioactive core to overheat no one died or even became sick as a result of any radiation leak the environmental protection agency found at the time but to those already skeptical of nuclear power the accident cemented the fear that no reactor could ever truly be safe enough that year activists rallied in the parking lot in front of borssele calling for an end to nuclear power in the netherlands hoping to get a formal read on where the dutch people stood the government in the late 1970s organized a public study and debate known as a broad societal discussion on nuclear power in 1984 the results of that public study showed a majority of the dutch did not favor building new nuclear power plants but the government still pressed ahead with plans to build as many as five new reactors then chernobyl happened in april 1986 operator errors and design flaws led to a meltdown at the chernobyl nuclear plant in soviet ukraine about two dozen workers and firefighters died and nearly 115000 people were forced to relocate away from the 1000squaremile irradiated exclusion zone the total death toll from the resulting radiation fallout remains the subject of debate in 2005 a team of 100 united nations scientists concluded that about 50 people had died of exposurerelated illnesses and projected that thyroid cancer would kill an additional 4000 in 2016 the world health organization traced more than 11000 thyroid cancer cases to chernobyl yet greenpeace a fierce opponent of nuclear energy has long promoted 93000 as the likely total death toll citing russian academic data and a wider range of illnesses that could potentially be linked to radiation exposure either way the disaster upended the nuclear debate across the world in the netherlands the public had already begun to turn against nuclear power in the years since it first built dodewaard the country had become a fossil fuel powerhouse producing the lions share of western europes natural gas from wells in its northernmost province of groningen oil and gas was booming and climate change was not widely understood so why take the risk with reactors shortly after the accident in ukraine the dutch government halted the process for selecting sites for two new reactors and began a herbezinning or rethinking of nuclear plans a uranium enrichment facility owned by the company urenco group opened in the eastern netherlands but by 1988 the dutch abandoned plans for more nuclear infrastructure in 1991 a joint dutchgerman reactor project just over the border in germany fell apart and within four years its buildings were sold and turned into an amusement park in 1997 the netherlands shut down the dodewaard plant years ahead of schedule as officials told reuters it was clear there was no political support for nuclear power in the netherlands the government slated borssele for closure in 2003 the antinuclear movement remained strong in 2001 dutch police arrested 16 demonstrators staging protests at borssele and the bythendefunct dodewaard facility but as the cold war memories faded and global temperatures began to tick upward public opinion on nuclear power started shifting again in 1996 just 14 of dutch adults considered nuclear energy to be a little or very good source for largescale electricity production that number ticked steadily downward before reaching 10 in 2001 according to university of amsterdam research in 2002 however the figure jumped to 21 then to 22 in 2003 and 24 in 2005 after its closure was postponed dutch regulators in 2006 granted borssele a license to operate through 2034 in 2009 the dutch utility delta which owns 70 of epz the company that operates borssele started the licensing process to build a second reactor next to the existing one in 2010 a general election propelled centerright prime minister mark rutte to power ruttes conservative vvd party had long supported the expansion of nuclear power and upon taking office the new administration revived plans to build the first new reactors in decades that november delta signed a memorandum of understanding with french utility giant edf to begin work on a reactor then disaster struck again in march 2011 an earthquake sent a tsunami crashing on japans northeast coast killing nearly 19000 people and disabling the power and cooling systems at the fukushimadaiichi nuclear plant a meltdown ensued at the longtroubled plant which was later revealed to have shirked modern safety standards and radiation rendered more than 300 square miles temporarily uninhabitable one worker later died of cancer the only death attributed to radiation and 573 evacuees mostly elderly residents died from stress related to the incident according to a survey by the newspaper yomiuri shimbun the response however was seismic japan halted all its reactors south koreas ruling liberal party adopted an unwavering antinuclear stance the us shelved most plans for new nuclear reactors and continued shutting down existing ones germany adopted the most extreme position making the closure of its nuclear fleet a priority over the next decade in the netherlands rutte called the german response curious and said he hoped to continue with plans for more nuclear power but delta struggled to find partners for the project and in 2011 delayed the licensing procedure in 2012 the municipally owned utility which has since changed its name to the provincial zeeland energy company suspended plans for a new reactor indefinitely by 2018 however the planets temperatures had risen by about 1 degree celsius on average causing billions of dollars in damage from the resulting increase in cataclysmic storms heat and floods far from even flattening out planetheating emissions were still growing year over year that october the un intergovernmental panel on climate change issued a stark new report outlining what it would mean if the planet warms by 15 degrees and what it would take to prevent that from happening the conclusions were relatively conservative given that the ipcc is a consensusbased body with hundreds of scientists from almost every country yet they were sobering humanity needed an unprecedented overhaul of the entire global economy and it needed to happen with almost unfathomable speed to do that the scientists concluded nuclear power would need to play a part even before the ipcc report came out pronuclear advocates had set their sights on the netherlands hoping the rutte governments embrace of atomic energy could yield a breakthrough in september 2018 michael shellenberger a pronuclear activist from california held a workshop in amsterdam for advocates hoping to reverse europes nuclear retreat known for his pugnacious style and political provocations the american who would later go on to make an unsuccessful bid for governor of california implored his audience to go on the offense and hold more public demonstrations in support of nuclear power in late october pronuclear activists gathered to do just that and held a rally in munich germany dutch news stations covered the event that rally and the tv coverage of it would prove remarkably effective among the many dutch viewers who saw the news segment was arjen lubach the host of a weekly satirical news show who is often compared to john oliver and with good reason both mens shows have a similar pacing and tone lubach devoted a 20minute segment of a november 2018 show to puncturing what he described as the myths and taboos of nuclear energy the ipcc basically says we cant go without nuclear energy we must use it and a lot of environmental groups for example greenpeace are in denial lubach said near the end of his monologue teeing up a clip of a dutch greenpeace spokesperson saying cleaner solutions are preferable to nuclear power yeah thats what everyone says lubach said throwing his arms up in the air everyone feels that way but we dont have that luxury the nuclear plant at borssele he said produced as much energy as 600 eiffel towersized wind turbines during one good year if we are serious about the climate we really need to think differently and look at nuclear power lubach said it may well be that in 40 years we invent something with really good batteries or that we produce energy from the static fur of our pets or whatever but as long as we dont have those optimistic futuristic techniques we just need nuclear power lubachs broadcasts often reached 600000 to 1 million viewers but that segment had been viewed more than 26 million times on youtube alone as of this june it marked something of a turning point within days of the episode airing lawmakers from ruttes vvd party introduced a proposal to build new nuclear plants and dutch newspapers especially the more conservativeleaning die telegraaf started pumping out a steady stream of stories backing up lubachs point that it was time to overcome old fears and embrace nuclear power again the resulting years of debate concluded last december with a coalition government agreement between ruttes vvd the centrist d66 party and two christian parties the agreement called for building two new nuclear power plants with 500 million euros or about 522 million in government spending to back the projects up by 2025 total government support for new nuclear the coalition projected would top 5 billion euros by the end of the decade the agreement listed borssele as one of three viable sites for the new reactors along with one in groningen and another outside rotterdam but in an interview with huffpost over zoom dutch energy minister rob jetten said borssele would be the most likely location a study by the consultancy kpmg last summer found that provincial officials in zeeland supported the buildout by july 1 jettens office said it would send a letter to the netherlands house of representatives the lower house of the countrys parliament outlining the governments process for building new reactors its considered the next procedural step before companies can start drafting proposals to supporters of nuclear power the steps marked desperately overdue progress at a time when its needed more urgently than ever before not only is the netherlands already on pace to miss its climate goals russias invasion of ukraine and the resulting sanctions and embargoes have sent oil and gas prices soaring across europe as their gas bills help fund the russian war effort european union countries are scrambling for alternatives including striking new deals to import liquefied natural gas from the us israel and egypt new supplies however have failed to match demand as russia slashed gas exports to europe this month sending prices soaring and forcing the regions largest economy germany to prepare for fuel rationing countries with more nuclear reactors have fared better romania which built two large nuclear power complexes in the 1980s is now looking to complete another two and remake itself as an energy hub for central europe finland offers a particularly poignant case study in support of nuclear power the nordic country which borders russia has long embraced atomic energy even groups like the local greenpeace chapter and the countrys green party traditionally beachheads for the antinuclear movement support the finnish industry thanks in part to that widespread support the finnish in march switched on the longdelayed olkiluoto3 one of the worlds largest reactors and the first new one in western europe in at least 15 years two months later russia cut off electricity exports to finland in retaliation for the countrys plan to ditch its decadeslong neutrality and join in the north atlantic treaty organization the move barely affected finland which could now generate nearly 40 of its national power needs from the three reactors on a tiny fleck of land off its southwest coast finland is dark for much of the year limiting how much solar power the country can generate the finns are building more wind energy but wind power alone cannot reliably power an industrial society of its size at least under current conditions milder than expected winds last summer increased european demand for gas just as prices for the fuel were already spiking making it harder for countries to refill stockpiles for the winter and recent research in the journal nature geosciences suggests wind patterns could shift significantly as the planet warms making that resource even less reliable in the years to come today wind turbines are ubiquitous in the netherlands towering even over densely populated areas near amsterdam in march the dutch government announced plans to double its offshore wind capacity but the country has pitched itself as europes future hub for green hydrogen a zerocarbon fuel that like fossil fuels can burn at high temperatures hydrogen is already widely used in fertilizers and industrial processes but virtually all of the fuel on the market today is produced with natural gas or coal to qualify as green in the hydrogen industrys colorcoding system the fuel must be made with machines called electrolysers that are powered by wind or solar electricity the netherlands has so far vowed to spend more on subsidies for green hydrogen and build more electrolyser plants than any other european union country but its a controversial energy solution because roughly 30 of that renewable electricity is lost in the conversion process for making hydrogen so for those plans to pan out the dutch will need to divert huge volumes of renewable power to hydrogen production how then is the netherlands supposed to produce enough zerocarbon power to replace its remaining coal and gasfired power plants while also providing for the new demand from electric vehicles and home appliances all while manufacturing green hydrogen in quantities large enough to be competitive majorities of dutch people would likely say the answer is nuclear power a 2018 poll from the news broadcaster eenvandaag found 54 of dutch adults in favor of nuclear power and 35 against when the question was reframed to say that the netherlands could achieve its 2050 climate goals with nuclear power 63 expressed support with only 27 against in 2019 51 of dutch adults supported new investments in nuclear energy with just 14 opposed in a survey from the pollster ipsos more than half of dutch people 35 and younger responded that they completely agree with building new nuclear power stations with less than onethird of respondents against it in a 2021 poll from the newspaper trouw and the electioninformation website kieskompas the one polling outlier appears to be a 2020 survey from the dutch central bureau of statistics which asked respondents to give their opinions on energy sources after explaining energy is sustainable when its produced by sources that dont hurt the climate and will never run out such as solar and wind nuclear advocates argue there is little to no risk of running short on uranium fuel given that reactors use so little and vast quantities could still be mined or extracted from seawater and while sunlight and wind are indeed virtually infinite resources the metals and alloys needed to make the photovoltaic panels and turbines that harness them are not yet that framing appeared to weigh on how the issue was perceived in response to the prompt 25 of those surveyed said they favored more nuclear power 12 said the current amount was appropriate about 18 said they preferred less nuclear power and a little over 25 wanted none of it at all a comedian may have helped shift dutch public opinion on nuclear power but asked where things go from here gerard brinkman one of the dutch antinuclear movements most prominent figures chortled this is not the first time for any of this he said over zoom last month we had the same proposal in 1985 then the accident in chernobyl halted those plans there were the same plans also in 2010 then came fukushima so as a sick joke i almost think that every time the rightwing parties in the netherlands are proposing to build new nuclear power plants there will be some new accident around the world hopefully not of course this might be gallows humor were brinkman not so convinced that the governments plans for new reactors would never make it past the paperwork phase advocates of nuclear power point to the united arab emirates barakah nuclear power plant as a sign that an industry revival is possible despite starting construction in 2011 just after the fukushima accident the 24 billion station in the abu dhabi desert completed construction on its third reactor last november the full trio built by south koreas korea electric power corp with enough capacity to supply 25 of the energythirsty uaes needs is scheduled to start producing power next year but the uae is an authoritarian country with almost unrivaled oil riches democratic countries with cultures and political systems more akin to the netherlands have faced steeper challenges in the us two south carolina utilities abruptly canceled construction on two new nuclear plants in 2017 after spending 9 billion and billing ratepayers for the cost now the only new reactors underway in the country are two units at the alvin w vogtle electric generating plant in eastern georgia the project broke ground in 2012 at a price tag of about 14 billion and promised to be producing electricity by 2017 after a series of delays the reactors have now cost more than 30 billion and wont be completed until next year at the earliest meanwhile states like new york and michigan have closed nuclear plants deemed safe to operate replacing the reactors with fossil fuels in the united kingdom hinkley point c a twounit nuclear plant the french utility giant edf is building in southwest england is facing similar delays and cost overruns with the price tag now topping 31 billion those problems have even crossed the english channel into france which famously generates most of its electricity from fission after building 56 nuclear reactors in just 15 years starting in the mid1970s in january edf announced delays and new expenses on its flamanville 3 reactor now a mysterious corrosion issue is plaguing nearly half of the countrys reactors with a dozen closed and awaiting inspections as of this month finland finished its olkiluoto3 but the project took 12 years to complete and the country pulled the plug on its next nuclear reactor a joint venture with the russian stateowned nuclear firm rosatom after the ukraine war broke out in an interview in a plain conference room at borssele carlo wolters the chief executive of the plant operator epz said his company would propose building the next dutch reactors right here but he said he would reject any bids from russian or chinese companies which he said posed too much geopolitical risk if you build a nuclear plant you have to look 60 years ahead so its wise to choose partners you can build a stable relationship with wolters said doing so however shrinks a pool of potential investors that critics of nuclear power say is already too shallow to yield results the reality is i dont think anything will be built said jan haverkamp a senior expert on nuclear energy and energy policy at greenpeace although the conservatives are claiming that there are interested parties in the market there are no really interested parties borssele is profitable epz said the kpmg study found that companies interested in bidding on nuclear projects or buying power from new reactors see a stable government policy on nuclear energy as a necessary precondition to building new facilities and the countrys prime minister for the last 12 years has remained steadfast in his support of nuclear power but the netherlands is bound by an international agreement known as the aarhus convention which gives countries within a certain radius of any large industrial projects including nuclear reactors the right to voice opposition germany and belgium both of which are on track to close their own nuclear reactors within the next few years would almost certainly challenge the dutch plans and even within the netherlands dutch law gives opponents of nuclear power ample opportunities to push back against the plans haverkamp is an expert at lining up rules and regulations and knowing when to interrupt something and when to stay quiet so definitely these guys will make it as difficult as possible said joris van dorp a pronuclear activist who helped organize the 2018 rally in munich he said he and other supporters of nuclear power were urging the rutte administration to prepare for those challenges in part by changing dutch laws to give reactors the same fasttrack process that benefits wind and solar projects but even that may prove ineffective against a determined opposition it only takes one guy or girl to chain themselves to a fence and lock down a whole building site for weeks you can do a lot of damage van dorp said you can really get people riled up and get people to accept that there are all sorts of ways you can stop these projects from proceeding within the confines of the law then its going to be hard traditionally conservative parties across the democratic world have favored nuclear power while those on the political left opposed it the realities of climate change have begun to shift that ideological mapping in many nations particularly among younger voters but in the netherlands that dynamic still holds with conservative and rightleaning parties largely backing nuclear power and those on the centerleft and left against the upstart progressive party volt is an outlier in its support for nuclear reactors though it only holds three seats in the parliament a dogged opponent of atomic energy groenlinks the green party has 16 seats d66 the secondlargest party after ruttes vvd and a member of the governing coalition remains split on nuclear power still silvio erkens a dutch member of parliament from the vvd party said at least twothirds of the legislature supports the prime ministers plan for new reactors am i certain they will be built as certain as you can be in parliament he said we reserved money for it got a majority in parliament and agreed that in the coming three years it will make the decision irreversible it will not be built in three years but it should be irreversible yet already some supporters of nuclear power have expressed concern that jetten the energy minister is slowwalking the governments letter to parliament on new nuclear reactors which was originally due to come out this month a member of the d66 party jetten previously opposed new reactors i was born and raised in a village where everyone is antinuclear because of the us air force presence over there everyone has an emotional history a family history and ive even got people in my own political party who joined antinuclear protests 30 years ago jetten told me over zoom but im now advocating for nuclear power because of the independence europe should get from russian imports countries that have invested more in nuclear power plants are in a better position these days still he said im 35 and i dont want to be a climate minister who was responsible for a huge nuclear waste problem that new generations have to deal with so there are pros and cons haverkamp said the governments money would be better spent on energy efficiency measures or building dense lowcarbon apartment buildings in a country struggling with a housing shortage and a dependence on gas heating systems even if the reactors were built he said it will take years they will not be connected to grids until 2034 or 2035 which means were spending 5 billion euros at least maybe more for climate solutions that will not be a climate solution for the next 13 to 14 years haverkamp said some nuclear boosters have suggested the netherlands should consider small modular reactors essentially reworked versions of the technology that powers nuclear submarines while estimates vary industry analysts generally project the technology will become commercially viable within the next five years and proponents say the smaller machines with parts that can be manufactured in a factory will be much cheaper and easier to deploy building nuclear power plants takes a lot of time and a lot of money these are political risks but i am confident the current political coalition is determined to get the ball rolling henri bontenbal an energy consultant and dutch member of parliament from the centerright christian democratic appeal party told me in an email therefore i believe that small nuclear reactors can be a worthwhile addition to the nuclear mix as those plants could operate before 2030 but supporters of nuclear power say building new reactors does in fact represent a longterm strategy and one that should not interfere with nearterm plans to deploy more renewables install more electric vehicle infrastructure and make buildings more efficient a large part of why nuclear plants have become so expensive and slow they argue is simply that few countries have been building them as such the workforce of designers project managers and construction crews with experience building reactors has shrunk over the past four decades the completion of projects in the uae us and finland could make more of those skills available to the netherlands restarting european nuclear construction is as painful as it is necessary said mark nelson a chicagobased nuclear engineer and consultant who advocates for atomic power who better to get it off to a good start again than the dutch who have always had to engineer to survive even if its difficult and costly research from the massachusetts institute of technology shows that the best way to truly decarbonize a power grid and avoid blackouts while doing so is to pair renewables with what are called firm sources of zerocarbon generation such as nuclear reactors hydroelectric dams or geothermal power the lowlying netherlands is too flat for dams and while geothermal energy has significant potential the country does not have the vast volcanic heat resources of nearby iceland renewables are very good but the economy as we know it today where we gained a lot of wealth longevity and healthier longer life through use of fossil energy you cant replace that with just renewables said floriske deutman a consultant and member of d66 who has tried to push the party to embrace nuclear power most people dont realize that she compared opposing nuclear energy as a tool to deal with climate change to opposing covid19 vaccines the hardcore antinuclear people are similar to the antivaccine movement because its based on misleading information to solve a problem deutman said unless solving the climate crisis and mitigating global warming is not your primary concern one may afternoon the sun broke through the clouds over borssele illuminating the construction cranes dismantling what remained of the coal plant epz once ran next to the nuclear station the nearby refinery was largely quiet the steam turbine in the nuclear plant hummed steadily during a tour of the facility to see the reactor up close a worker told me you could see the hyperboloid cooling towers of belgiums doel nuclear power station from atop the dike that protected this part of zeeland from the north sea the plant located on the outskirts of the belgian industrial metropolis antwerp was one of the countrys last two nuclear stations the plan had been to shut both facilities down in the next three years though the government in brussels is reconsidering as energy prices spike i climbed the grassy barrier which had been elevated after the devastating 1953 floods that killed more than 1800 people for centuries the dutch had summoned their country from watery depths draining swamps digging canals and redirecting rivers to claim land for their people but after that catastrophe the netherlands renewed its commitment to engineering its longterm survival in a place that could be easily reclaimed by the sea up went higher sea barriers from atop the dike antwerp was invisible shrouded behind a veil of smog and haze as i squinted i wondered could the view possibly be clearer from the other side

development consultant organized what was to be a oneoff dinner to connect syrians and canadians the continuing dinners are a breakout hit what is syrian food it is muttabal shamandar a velvety dip fragrant with beets tahini and olive oil it is baba ghannouj a chunky riot of eggplant and bell pepper it is kebab hindi tender meatballs swaddled in spicy tomato sauce to vancouverites syrian food is in part a way to support recently arrived refugees and to the syrian women who prepare the food it is a way to find their footing in a new home one year ago nihal elwan founded tayybeh a celebration of syrian cuisine with a 500 cad grant from a local foundation the cairoborn international development consultant organized what was to be a oneoff dinner to connect syrians and canadians today tayybeh pronounced tiebeh holds dinners every six to eight weeks typically selling out the 150seat feasts within hours theyve also launched a catering company we want to create bridges with different communities in the city says elwan so far theyve cooked in a palestinian restaurant church halls and a grade school cafeteria in september i was one of 160 people at the largest tayybeh dinner to date held at the vancouver japanese language school the location really resonated with us given the japanese community were newcomers and that they went through their fair share of adversity says nihal referring to a period in the 1940s when the government seized japanesecanadians property and sent them to internment camps under the roof of one communitys resilience we dug in to help another establish itself i couldnt stop spooning up mloukheye bil jaij middle eastern greens with chicken the first bite yielded a silky green reminiscent of teaslightly tannic with the texture of chardthat gave way to the richness of a sunday roast chicken then a punch of tomato and lemon that night i dreamed of pomegranates chicken stew and nearly fluorescent beet dip when i meet maha almaarabani a few weeks later her magenta headscarf and hotpink tayybeh apron echo the color of that dip originally from damascus she came to vancouver in october 2016 and coincidentally mloukheye is her favorite dish to prepare the stew with greens and chicken i ask my excitement needs no translation with nihal acting as interpreter maha explains that each syrian city has a different way of preparing the dish a few feet away raghda hassan pauses from stuffing rounds of dough with a cheeseolive mixture to wink at me you tried the recipe from latakia where raghda is from says nihal as raghda and maha debate she translates in latakia the greens are boiled in water first while in damascus theyre panfried in ghee for a crunchier texture in vancouver the ladies buy the greens dried and can only find them in a few arab storesa far cry from back home where maha got fresh leaves and dried them herself canadian cheese is challenging too nihal says theyve tried many different kinds but they keep saying its not right its not right meat comes frozen from the halal butcher when i ask about it maha makes a face she says everything tastes different here the meat is almost dry translates nihal for the ladies the tayybeh project is a natural extension of what theyve done their whole lives cook and welcome people to the table still the ladies power through as best they can the notion of a recipe in the western sense seems foreign to them maha says she has a breath for cooking that doesnt rely on instructions another tayybeh chef hasna shekh omar blends dishes and techniques from idlib aleppo and regions across the turkish border for the ladies the tayybeh project is a natural extension of what theyve done their whole lives cook and welcome people to the table it is especially fitting for hasna whose seven children are now spread among canada turkey and syria you see how all these people come to our dinners and they love our food this is the same that we had in syria she says through nihal but its also something new raghda and maha and hasna have never worked outside their homes never mind in a professional kitchen for them the company is a gateway not just to a better income than theyd receive in other restaurant work but to developing the skills they need in vancouver learning english navigating public transit and building up a resume so what does syrian food taste like it tastes like dried greens from the arabic store soaked in water like they do in latakia melded with stock from toolean canadian chicken and stewed until silky to vancouverites it tastes like a popup dinner in a community hall to the ladies of tayybeh it doesnt quite taste like home but it tastes like home for now we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism

science the power of stories in the 21st century it says a lot about my family that my big fun invitation for memorial day weekend was to the narrating science conference the power of stories in the 21st century together dad me sibling mom and spouse spell steam which adds art particularly design to the science technology engineering and mathematics acronym also a zoologist mom doubles for scienceart depending upon ones nerdy needs i am geeky enough to have posed four of us as stem during a hawaiian vacation we like thinking and especially having time to sit and think and explore new perspectives it seems like such a luxury so yes an invitation to a fiction meets science conference was well received dont worry friends i know it is better to invite most of you to a weekend in vegas father and husband at home i honestly expected the other two of our tea to abandon parts of the conference in order to tour toronto instead we three sat in a snug thankgawditsawindowful room taking diligent notes and discussing the presentations long into the evening from the influence of roots on human origin stories josie gill to south parks use of science to illuminate moral hypocrisy edward bankes to david a kirbys controversial stance that the film hidden figures was about discrimination not about science and could therefore have followed black women lawyers and told the same story absolutely not it became clear to me that the conference was ultimately about the power of alternative facts stories whether motion picture or text are product not only of their modes of production but also what audiences want to see how else does someone read the hunger games novels description of the character rue including her thick dark hair and dark satiny brown skin and still picture a little blonde innocent girl until the movie comes out and because rues black her death wasnt as sad how else do audiences watch a film like hidden figures and celebrate the fictional desegregation of jim crow bathrooms by the composite ie fabricated white character al harrison when the real katherine johnson desegregated nasa bathrooms herself frankly how else do audiences dub hidden figures a feel good movie when it ends with genius black women who were more highly skilled than the white people around them taking one step up a skyscraper length ladder and remaining employed far beneath their aptitude and out of the public discourse for half a century the gdiq would more accurately tabulate the stats but audiences might also feel dejected by white males garnering the lions share of speaking and screen time over the black women who in theory lead the film leveling another challenge to the revelries audiences ignore most of these contexts in order to focus on what they want to see a film about black women scientists and their extraordinary contributions to space exploration certainly that narrative predominates the headlines but the rest becomes part of audiences too narrating science touched on how stories open us to absorbing their components as truth because they lower our resistance to persuasion matteo farinella while a viewer may protest that anything outside of the pride in nasas black women human computers does not impact the takeaways what becomes truth for that viewer is the elevation of white heroes the idea that any gains by black people are because of white people that we all should focus on small steps that those are good enough and that the big picture is rightfully ignored we want to feel affirmed that is the one goal we humans have in common we want that feeling so badly we put blinders on ourselves humans cant get it together enough to end light pollution an easy fix if ever there were one cynthia tarr but we ignore our ineptitude at that simple task and convince ourselves that people will overcome the horrors that are already befalling us from climate change the window to avoid catastrophic climate change closed and yet we continue to tell lies so that we feel better more aligned with what we want reality to be we wont be better but we will perish feeling more resolved how do we overcome our craving for alternative facts this question was asked in multiple forms during the conference one presenter wondered how to convince certain populations of scientists of the obvious that the ways they set up their experiments shape the results priscilla wald another wondered how to persuade people that accidents are inevitable that the ways in which we gravitate toward blaming human error reject the certainty of eg nuclear meltdown david k hecht i comment in simpler terms just because you get pregnant it does not mean that birth control pills arent 91 effective you just happen to be the one in eleven however most humans resist such reflection therein lies the appeal of science it probes why anyone should be able to patent cells genes and organisms above and beyond whether hela cells should profit henrietta lackss survivors it considers the commercialization of virtual reality and the frankly predictable increase in mental health issues in the general population of consumers particularly gamers addicted to first person shooters it should also ask why at an international conference on the power of stories in the 21st century the overwhelming majority of participants are fair skinned my mother being the only attendee

now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again i suspect many at the conference find themselves in the same position i am in focusing much of observation research andor activism on the trees and neglecting the forest in a world of alternative facts the latter is overwhelming truth we give more power and income to those who make us feel a certain way than to those who do the heavy lifting of what we actually need to live we compensate celebrities of acting sport and music more than those who harvest our food than those who keep our immediate environments sanitary educators and civil rights attorneys enjoy far less celebration and income for their contributions than that spokesperson who sells you product in a series of 30 second spots i should know i have been all three and was never paid as much nor received as many fanatical accolades as for selling strangers things they dont actually need in short television ads joan haran emphasized the role of hope in speculative science but that hope is expansive we revere those who make us feel as we wish who affirm what we want to believe is true of course we as consequence then rebuff those who pull our blinders off we reject truth in favor of more affirming alternatives

environment today on the anniversary of hurricane sandy brown university defied the will of its student body and its own investment advisory committee and voted not to divest from the 15 largest us coal companies im deeply disappointed in our administration said brown student ruby goldberg 17 the board acted explicitly in opposition to the voices of browns community and of the endowment oversight committee this could have been a moment for brown to step up as a leader in the fight against climate change instead the administration chose to continue supporting an industry that profits from wreaking havoc on frontline communities and destroying our chance for a sustainable future the decision comes as the fossil fuel divestment campaign continues to pick up momentum around the world there are now active divestment campaigns underway at over 400 colleges cities and religious institutions across the us the campaign is also spreading to europe where bill mckibben and 350org are kicking off the fossil free europe tour in berlin this evening recently the university of oxford published a study concluding that the fossil fuel divestment movement is growing even faster than past efforts that targeted apartheid and big tobacco students at brown have worked as hard or harder than any others in the country and more to the point theyve done absolutely everything by the book said bill mckibben the environmental writer and founder of 350org an international climate campaign helping coordinate the divestment campaign they deserved to win this fight and in the long run they will win this fight because its their future at stake not the future of a handful of rich people on the brown board the boards vote came after a year of active campaigning from the brown divest coal student campaign since the fall students have held rallies phonebanked hosted teachins met with administrators and gathered over 3600 petition signatures from students alumni faculty and staff in support of divestment to me this vote shows that brown doesnt take its commitments to social justice and combating climate change seriously said divest coal member kari malkki 16 whats the point of teaching about climate science or environmental racism if we wont act on that knowledge today our administration was too timid to challenge the status quo but were going to keep pushing them to stand for what is right until then our boldly brown motto sounds laughable theres good reason to believe that browns decision not to divest was influenced by the ties a number of its board members have to the fossil fuel industry in an oped published in the brown daily herald members of the brown divest coal campaign identified several board members with significant holdings in the coal industry including brian moynihan 81 p14 president and ceo of bank of america which as of aug 14 has 1 billion worth of holdings in 14 of the 15 companies in question brown students recently published an oped requesting these board members recuse themselves from the coal divestment vote but they received no response the voting process at brown echos the coal industrys stranglehold on our nations governing bodies once again a corrupt process lead to a dangerous outcome said ian georgianna 15 a member of brown divest coal unless we confront this system we wont be able to make meaningful progress to address climate change brown university president christina h paxson announced the corporations decision in an open letter posted on the universitys website while she acknowledged the threat posed by climate change and the environmental damage caused by the coal industry she offered two faulty arguments to why the university would not divest first president paxson argued that while coal posed certain environmental risks it did not cause enough social harm to warrant divestment this conclusion is directly contradicted by numerous studies that highlight the enormous social cost of coal consumption the 2010 hidden cost of energy study from the national academy of sciences estimated that the damage from coal fired power plant emission in 2005 cost the nation about 62 billion and that costs would only increase a 2011 harvard university study calculated that coal costs us onethird to over onehalf a trillion dollars annually coal is also one of the main drivers of climate change which if left unaddressed could cut off up to 20 percent of global gdp according to the 2006 stern review we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone

now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again the universitys own advisory committee on corporate responsibility and investment policy recently encouraged the board to divest from the coal industry writing the companies recommended for divestment perpetrate grave indeed egregious social harm and there is no possible way to square our profiting from such harm with the values and principles of the university second president paxson argued that divestment was an ineffective tool to changing the behavior of the fossil fuel industry and addressing the climate crisis a claim that both academic studies and historical experience refute a recent study by the university of oxford concluded that the current fossil fuel divestment campaign is growing faster than any previous divestment campaign and could cause significant damage to coal oil and gas companies the campaign also has the blessing of a leader of the antiapartheid divestment movement nobelpeace prize winner archbishop desmond tutu who wrote divestment played a key role in helping liberate south africa the corporations understood money even when they werent swayed by morality climate change is a deeply moral issue too the antiapartheid movement continues to serve as a useful model for current divestment activists many universities including harvard which recently said no

science maya historyand the civilizations collapsecontinue to occupy the minds of archeologists some research points to a series of droughts as playing an important role in the maya demise other researchers propose the ancient maya were less resilient to fight for survival due to religious beliefs and now dr gary feinman an archaeologist at chicagos field museum has suggested a new explanation when he came facetoface with a detailed map of trade patterns from an episode of maya historyit was his aha moment he said dr feinman and a team of researchers from the university of illinois at chicago studied how the precious material obsidian or volcanic glass was traded and used by inland maya communities during the classic period just years before the mysterious maya collapse when this research was displayed on the map an interesting pattern emerged the originally inland trade system evolved into a primarily coastal system which suggested the inland maya communities no longer had easy access to obsidian and other resources after that the populations in inland areas drastically declined the collapse of these inland riverine centers has been a topic of discussion for a hundred years at least and there are lots of ideas that have been put forth as possibly being responsible dr feinman told the huffington post our study suggests that at least one of those factors may have been this changing route of exchange and the decline of accessor ability of people at these inland centersto get obsidian through the riverine trade routes eventually the coastal trade routes grew in importance and the obsidian sources that were traded along the coast became predominant in the area the researchers study doesnt directly address why there was a shift in trade routes but dr feinman said there could have been conflict between communities making the routes precarious or impassable its really kind of astounding dr feinman said some of these data had been published before but when you look at the patterns of change graphically and you look at the maps all of a sudden its sort of wow you see new things trade of any resourcenot just obsidianwas important for maya survival but dr feinman cautioned not to misconstrue this research as the ultimate explanation for the collapse of the mayan civilization people assume that when a civilization collapses its likely that theres one catastrophic event that leads to that decline and generally that is not the case he said even if a catastrophic event has an effect its also because theres some underlying issues or tensions or problems in the society before that environmental shift or change while were going there the whole idea of the maya collapse is somewhat a misconception dr feinman said we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again maya still exist today he said mayan languages aspects of their culture still exist today certainly the dna of ancient maya still survive in living populations so one misconception is the idea that the maya disappeared when of course they did not dr feinman and his research teams findings were published online may 23 2012 in the journal antiquity

science with its ruling in obergefell v hodges the us supreme court took a step that seemed unimaginable two decades ago when i started researching samesex marriage many politicians pundits and commentators have rightly hailed the courts decision as both just and historic legal experts can parse the finer points of the majority opinion and the four separate dissents but lets take this momentous occasion as an opportunity to reflect on where we have been on this issue and what the future may hold first a look backward although the dissents in obergefell claimed that americans should be given more time to sort out this issue through the democratic process the history of the struggle over samesex marriage is actually rather long the first court ruling on the issue dates back to 1971 when the minnesota supreme court found in baker v nelson that neither the state nor the federal constitution guaranteed a right to samesex marriage but the issue really broke into public consciousness in the mid1990s when another state supreme court this time in hawaii ruled its state constitution did in fact require the state to issue marriage licenses to samesex couples that ruling prompted congress to pass the defense of marriage act doma in 1996 and many state legislatures including hawaiis passed their own baby domas to ensure they would not have to recognize samesex marriages then in 2004 massachusetts became the first us state to issue marriage licenses to samesex couples and for the next decade opponents and advocates of marriage equality fought ferocious and emotional battles in state after state speaking in the rose garden shortly after the obergefell decision came down president obama lauded the ruling and asserted that the result was a consequence of countless small acts of courage by people who came out to others and stood up for themselves obama framed the marriage victory as a vindication of the belief that ordinary people can do extraordinary things and those words resonated for me as i thought about the plaintiffs in the earliest marriage cases in minnesota hawaii and elsewhere who pursued dignity and equal treatment on their own without the support of a coordinated strategic effort by the national lgbt rights movement indeed it was only after the initial favorable ruling in hawaii that the national gay rights groups were willing to devote significant attention and resources to the marriage issue a detail that is easy to forget after years of highprofile professionalized activism on marriage equality even those in the lgbt community who think other issues should have had priority over marriage or who reject the institution outright must be heartened by this evidence that major social change that starts at the grassroots is still achievable in our age of deep political cynicism and polarization the littlenoted irony of the marriage equality victory is that it arrives at a moment when more heterosexual americans are turning away from marriage this retreat from marriage as family scholars call it manifests in lower marriage rates a higher age at first marriage more children born to unmarried parents and a high divorce rate the causes of the retreat from marriage are complex but its clear the phenomenon is not spread evenly over the american population it is disproportionately people on the lower rungs of the socioeconomic ladder who are delaying or foregoing marriage or dissolving their existing marriages the economic conditions produced by deindustrialization and globalization are a significant factor stagnant wages and employment insecurity place lesseducated americans in a precarious position and many now view marriage as a kind of middleclass luxury good that is out of reach or irrelevant

you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again recognizing this larger reality of american marriage does not negate the value of expanding marriage rights to include samesex couples but as we celebrate marriage equality we must also acknowledge that the broader retreat from marriage is both a cause and a consequence of widening economic inequalities in our country the optimism and enthusiasm of samesex couples choosing marriage may be refreshing but it will probably do little to reverse these broader trends where are we headed in the short term the nationalization of samesex marriage recognition will further increase the cultural visibility of sexual minorities and alternative family forms legal battles over samesex marriage will shift to the terrain of religious liberty where opponents of marriage equality will seek to use religious freedom arguments as grounds for ongoing discrimination against samesex couples even if those legal fights are resolved fairly quickly it will not be time for the lgbt rights movement to declare victory and close up shop the majority of us states still lack antidiscrimination laws covering sexual orientation and gender identity and efforts to pass a federal employment nondiscrimination law have failed repeatedly in congress hate crimes and bullying continue to pose difficult and sometimes lifethreatening challenges for sexual minorities and gender variant people and while caitlyn jenners coming out has generated mostly positive reactions transgender rights issues are only starting to get the attention they require finally i hope that lgbt folk of all political persuasions will view the marriage victory as an invaluable opportunity to dedicate our resources and creativity to more coalitionbuilding with other groups fighting for social justice in public statements on the steps of the supreme court right after the ruling was announced both lead plaintiff james obergefell and plaintiffs attorney mary bonauto made a point to acknowledge the deep pain of the charleston massacre and the reality that discrimination and hate persist in many forms in contemporary america i thank them for using their moment in the public spotlight to link lgbt rights struggles to other important issues confronting our nation their sentiments represent the most inspiring and expansive elements of the lgbt rights crusade a recognition of the importance of dignity and equality for all people of how struggles for social justice are interlinked and of the power of coalitions to create strength greater than the sum of their parts

science i dont know how many of you saw this article in the new england journal of medicine published on october 10 2012 chocolate consumption cognitive function and nobel laureates in it the author franz h messerli md claims to have found a strong linear correlation r791 between the amount of chocolate consumed by a country and the number of nobel prize winners from that country both measured on a per capita basis dr messerli is a cardiologist and director of clinical hypertension with st lukes and roosevelt hospital while messerli warns in his paper that the existence of a correlation does not imply causation this did not stop the popular media from running stories with these headlines eating chocolate may help you win nobel prize cbs news correlation between countrys chocolate consumption and nobel prize winners surprisingly powerful says study associated press why chocolate makes you smart or peaceful psychology today study links eating chocolate to winning nobels usa today messerlis results immediately got my attention because i have been doing a lot of work lately on sugar and how deleterious it is to ones diet and its links to obesity and chocolate often finds itself attached to sugar when consumed i decided to do my own study to make a point i decided to see if there was a correlation between the amount of chocolate a country consumes and the number of winter olympic medals the country has won over time both measured on a per capita basis while my correlation statistics are not quite as good as dr messerlis certainly they are strong enough to get published in any respectable academic journal correlation coefficient 57 note the correlation would have been even better if the danes and the irish both big consumers of chocolate had more than only one winter olympic medal won between them so what is going on here can eating chocolate make you more likely to win a nobel prize if so then by the same logic it appears that eating chocolate can make you a better skier or skater unfortunately i dont believe either of these suppositions is correct i think these false correlations exist because chocolate consumption nobel prize winning and winter olympic medals are all correlated with something else which is not ever raised in these studies what might that something else be i would argue chocolate consumption nobels and winter olympic medals increase with the following factors if these are the true causal variables to how much chocolate is consumed one cannot conclude that eating more chocolate makes you smarter or a better skier this is a classic problem in statistics known as the omitted variable problem you can get very good correlation statistics between two or here three variables which may not be causally related at all but rather both are correlated and caused by a third yet undisclosed variable alas if you want to get smarter you will have to go back to reading books and if you want to ski better you will have to hit the slopes but if you want to get fat just keep eating sugarlaced chocolate treats we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again john r talbott is a best selling author and economic consultant to families whose books predicted the housing crash and the economic crisis you can read more about his books the accuracy of his predictions and his financial consulting activities at wwwstopthelyingcom
economy a sixth woman has come forward to complain about sexual discrimination at monster energy a maledominated beverage company that appears to be plagued by a toxic work culture the woman karen simmons a 50yearold former sales representative based in alabama spent nearly two years with monster she amassed a strong track record even as she fended off one of her atlantabased managers ted cook who hit on her made comments about her breasts tried to get her drunk and invited her more than once for an evening nightcap in his hotel room on work trips she told huffpost robert duck simmons direct boss who works out of monsters office in florida also witnessed cooks behavior but told her to brush it off she said he said ted was harmless a dirty old man simmons recalled through a company spokesman duck said simmons never complained when reached by phone by huffpost he hung up he did not respond to followup texts cook also did not respond to a call text or linkedin message simmons took her complaints no further what was i gonna say i loved my job i needed my job she said simmons had worked for about 20 years in the beverage industry a notoriously unfriendly business for women i knew saying things gets you retaliation what simmons did not realize was that whether or not she spoke up she was already trapped inside a company where the odds are stacked against women last april simmons was fired for reasons she still doesnt quite understand monster says it was for poor performance according to a spokesman for the company simmons says her dismissal occurred a few months after receiving a generally positive performance review and just as she was poised to win an internal sales contest in the fall she filed sex and age discrimination charges against monster at the us equal employment opportunity commission i knew saying things gets you retaliation monster is also facing lawsuits from five other women over complaints of sexual discrimination and other issues as first reported in a huffpost investigation in january one monster executive head of music marketing brent hamilton is facing felony assault charges for allegedly strangling his girlfriend on a company business trip he is still employed by the company another executive john kenneally a vice president accused of sexually harassing two women at the company resigned after huffpost published details of the accusations in january he ran the business unit that simmons worked in in public statements at the time the company painted the women as disgruntled employees and said that the suits were unrelated monster energy has zerotolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind the company said in january monster takes all reported complaints very seriously any suggestions to the contrary are false just as huffpost was set to publish this story monster announced it was hiring a third party to review its human resource policies and procedures the investigators will report straight to the companys board of directors we are confident that the recent portrayal of the company in the media is not representative of our culture and practices monster chairman and ceo rodney sacks and vice chair and president hilton schlosberg said in a statement but they added that in the context of the allegations made by the women bringing these lawsuits we believe it is prudent the company declined to provide more details on the third party if there are areas where there are deficients we will correct them sacks and schlosberg said in a statement to huffpost earlier in march monster said it wasnt aware of simmons complaints until recently ms simmons did not make any allegation of harassment to the company or to her manager while she was employed by the company the statement said monster only learned of the claim at a mediation session with simmons and her lawyer in midfebruary the statement said this was about three weeks after huffpost published its investigation the statement points out monster also said that cook is no longer with the company simmons former boss duck who she said witnessed cooks behavior is still working at monster through a spokesman monster also told huffpost that simmons account was not accurate simmons last employee evaluation included significant feedback about areas for improvement the spokesman said it was not positive in response to other questions and requests for information the spokesman wrote many of the other allegations or questions are untrue are missing facts or are irrelevant but we are not going to engage in a back and forth about this after reading huffposts reports and looking into the cases filed against monster simmons was shocked to learn that another female employee at the company page zeringue had gone to the human resources department to complain about cook well before simmons started working under him in a lawsuit against monster zeringue alleges that her complaint to hr helped trigger her firing ostensibly for bad performance meanwhile cook was sent to sexual harassment training according to internal documents viewed by huffpost this was around the same time simmons was hired monster energy markets its drinks primarily to men using cliched tropes about masculinity scantily clad monster girls in leather bikini tops serve as brand ambassadors one beverage is actually called assault a few years ago the company gave out monster branded condoms as a promotional gimmick that toxic male culture translates into policy where sexual harassment is not taken seriously monsters employee guidelines reviewed by huffpost require that managers who observe sexual misconduct must report it but in simmons case it appears that her direct boss duck never informed hr about cooks conduct even if hr learns about misbehavior what passes for an investigation into sexual harassment complaints seems to amount to a surface questioning of the parties involved where the accounts of men are weighed more seriously at monster terminations may be helped along by a confusing performance review process where managers are allowed to add damaging comments into evaluations months after employees read their reviews according to documents reviewed by huffpost even in an industry known for being heavily male monster stands out particularly in the sales division where simmons worked overall only 13 percent of the companys 505person us sales team are women if you include administrative assistants the percentage rises to 18 percent female according to an internal employee directory from january obtained by huffpost none of the companys 11 vicepresidents in sales are women monster said some of the numbers huffpost obtained were incorrect but declined to offer specifics or provide its own data in an earlier statement to huffpost the company said many women hold top leadership positions within monster and pointed to its chief commercialization officer emelie tirre still sales is so maledominated at monster that at a 2016 national sales meeting in las vegas even with human resource representatives in attendance a vicepresident told a blatantly misogynistic joke to a packed room according to three separate accounts from current and former employees the joke goes like this there is an old bull and a young bull on a hill overlooking a field of cows young bull says to the old bull lets run down there and fuck a cow old bull says nah lets walk down there and fuck them all the more ted drank the handsier he got simmons recalls being appalled but she was used to hearing sexist talk from male colleagues after all she had spent most of her career in beverage sales a notoriously sexist culture she knew how to handle herself over the past three years at least four other women in the east division where simmons worked were fired or pushed out they include simmons two other women who are suing the company for sex discrimination and one who declined to speak on the record with huffpost but has since quit as of january 2018 there were only 16 women out of 153 employees working in the east division simmons was often the only woman at the dinners and events where she would meet up with cook and duck given the companys cultural penchant for partying drinking alcohol at these meetups was a given she didnt drink and repeatedly rebuffed cooks efforts to get her drunk she said she declined his invitations for a nightcap in his hotel room the more ted drank the more handsy he got simmons told huffpost on one occasion when he asked for a hug simmons said she uncomfortably gave him a halfhug he wasnt satisfied and pulled her in for a doover she said he said i felt that simmons said meaning he could feel the pressure of her breasts on his chest arguably simmons should never have had to deal with cook in the first place two years earlier zeringue had filed her complaint about him with the human resources department according to the lawsuit she filed last year against the company huffpost obtained zeringues original complaint to hr in it she said cook had a reputation for getting grabby when he drinks and was known as touchy ted around the office she detailed an incident where he talked to her about her breasts and those of a coworker he also pulled the huggingclose move on her she said the hr department reached out to cooks boss kenneally the executive who recently resigned in the face of harassment allegations after huffposts investigation published kenneally defended cook telling the hr representative he had already spoken with him about the incident and there were no noted recurrences according to a review of an internal hr report obtained by huffpost kenneally also made a point of criticizing zeringue her performance is not where it needs to be he is quoted as saying when cook was confronted by hr he confessed and said he learned his lesson according to internal notes he also conceded that touchy ted was one of the nicknames he was known by inside the company another being uncle ted he was assigned to sexual harassment training called stop sexual harassment training for supervisors and given a warning its unclear if hr ever planned any kind of followup to make sure he stayed on track zeringue was fired a month later in her complaint against monster she claims her firing amounted to retaliation for speaking up that suit is now headed to private arbitration outside the public court system it was around this time at a dinner in new orleans that simmons attended with cook duck and several other male monster employees that she said she heard them joking about having to go to hr classes if they misbehaved it was just like a big joke simmons said simmons last few months at monster played out like a corporate gaslighting in february 2017 less than two months after she had received a decent performance review from duck he asked to meet up with her in florida where they had both traveled for business what happened next came as a total shock duck showed her a disciplinary writeup for stuff i didnt do simmons said the writeup which huffpost has reviewed claimed she was unwilling to leave her hometown for work yet she was in florida on a business trip at the time she was given the writeup i was out of town every week she said the writeup also claims that duck spoke with simmons in january about these issues simmons said the only feedback she got that month came when she downloaded her performance review from the companys internal website monster provided huffpost with a copy of the document dated dec 31 the review judges simmons performance as meets standards giving her a 214 rating out of 4 and was generally upbeat and positive but is peppered with constructive criticism at this point the only thing i can ask karen to improve on is slowing down duck wrote she also needs a little more work on time management he called her a great problem solver who sometimes needs help prioritizing i have asked her to make sure when she schedules a meetingto always make sure she can do it in the category of job knowledge and skill duck gave simmons a rating of 3 or exceeds expectations so the negative writeup baffled simmons where is this coming from she asked him she wanted to understand what she did wrong so she could fix things he refused to provide more details he said i was making things worse and to go home and forget about it simmons said for about a monthandahalf after that duck still simmons direct supervisor did not talk to simmons she said he wouldnt respond to texts or calls one thing he apparently did do update simmons dec 31 performance review topping the document off with an extremely harsh summary paragraph slamming her for poor performance the added paragraph is dated march 3 2017 the tone of this text is vastly different from the rest of the document at this point karen has lost the trust of some of her bottlers and needs to fix this soon or she will struggle duck wrote karen acts disconnected in meetings and face to face with her coke partners duck used gendercoded words like abrasive and demanding to describe her demeanor with outside contacts at cocacola bottlers simmons worked with the final comment was meant to assess simmons work from the end of december through march a monster spokesman told huffpost the final comments reflect not only her managers assessment of her work through 123117 he said but the final comment on 030317 was also influenced by her performance in the months after 123117 and before the final comment simmons said she had not seen this paragraph until she was asked about it by huffpost monster which provided huffpost with the review claimed that simmons had likely seen the additional paragraph however monster could not provide evidence that she did according to monsters records simmons signed her review on march 1 two days before duck signed off on the harsh additional paragraph finally in late april duck broke the silence he called simmons and said he needed to meet in person but when he met her in a hotel lobby in her hometown of daphne alabama he was there with cook and they had an hr representative on the phone to talk to her it was like somebody just punched me in the stomach simmons said she cried and begged she said telling them she needed the insurance and that her family would suffer she was offered two weeks severance if she signed a document promising not to sue i didnt sign i just think it was wrong it was totally wrong she said two weeks pay for what they did is wrong zeringue the woman who had complained about cook years earlier also was offered two weeks severance when she was fired she declined too interestingly cook retired less than a month later its unclear why his colleagues threw him a going away party and just a few months later during christmas time in 2017 cook returned to monsters atlanta office dressed up as santa claus young women at the office sat in his lap and posed for pictures one woman posted a shot on facebook captioned uncleted simmons meanwhile took her dismissal hard she was so embarrassed about being fired that she stopped leaving her home during the day not wanting anyone in her small alabama hometown to ask her why she wasnt working the first six months were awful she said if i needed to go out id go at three or four in the morning or ten or 11 at night because she lost her job simmons husband a 68yearold who supervises utility crews in tampa has had to put off his retirement he had relocated to tampa temporarily to make a little extra cash before finishing his career now its unclear when he can come home this has affected my marriage my life its been really tough on my family she said breaking down in tears simmons is responsible for paying college tuition for her 21yearold daughter my daughter worries all the time i told her dont worry about it well figure a way around it do you have a story to tell about sexual harassment or discrimination at monster or another workplace email emilypeckhuffpostcom
social three young siblings caught in their parents custody fight were berated by a michigan judge and sent to juvenile detention after they refused to have lunch with their dad omer tsimhoni and maya eibschitztsimhonis 9yearold daughter and their 10 and 15yearold sons have been incarcerated at a juvenile center for more than two weeks collateral damage in their divorced parents court battle the kids have been locked up since a june 24 hearing before oakland county circuit judge lisa gorcyca to arrange visitation with their parents the children told the judge they didnt want to spend time with their dad who has a job in israel but comes to the detroit area often rather than listen to the childrens reasons for avoiding their father the judge belittled and threatened them according to a hearing transcript first posted by fox 2 detroit gorcyca imposed the harsh punishment after the older tsimhoni son obeyed the judges command to apologize but not to his father hes violent and he i saw him hit my mom and im not gonna talk to him the teen said tsimhoni denied hitting his ex in an interview with the new york observer and claimed his former wife made up the story and convinced their kids it was real gorcyca ignored the teens allegation and found him guilty of civil contempt after praising the father effusively she called the son a defiant contemptuous young man youre supposed to have a high iq which im doubting right now gorcyca told the boy according to the transcript you have no manners with coaxing from their attorneys the two younger tsimhoni siblings each apologized and said they would try to connect with their dad gorcyca ordered them to have a pleasant lunch with their father or theyd be incarcerated do you like going to the bathroom in front of people she asked the girl threatening to send her to detention for her birthday gorcyca said she would use security cameras to keep track of the childrens behavior after hearing the judges warnings the sister and younger brother said they would rather be sent to juvenile detention with their older sibling every single adult in this courtroom thinks you have been brainwashed gorcyca told them she said they were like charles manson cult members gorcyca sentenced all three children to a youth shelter the shelter holds three dozen people said george miller director of the oakland county department of health and human services which oversees the center the judge banned the mother from visiting and ordered that the siblings be kept away from each other as much as possible gorcyca set a review of the punishment for sept 8 but said the father may request an earlier hearing if the children start getting along with him when you can follow the courts direct order and have a normal healthy relationship with your father i would review this gorcyca said it might be three years it might not be till youre 18 gorcyca wont comment on an open case a staffer in her office said jennifer lord an attorney who belongs to the growing facebook group supporting the tsimhoni kids said judges arent supposed to adjudicate how a child feels about his family family judges theyre the ones who are supposed to be listening to the children she said tsimhoni and eibschitztsimhoni declined interview requests omer tsimhoni wrote in an email that he hopes to eventually have a healthy relationship with his kids i am hurt but mostly very sad for my children he said i love them and miss them i cannot understand something like that can even happen in this country eibschitztsimhoni told fox 2 i want them back home outrage appears to be growing as news of the punishment spreads a small group protested in front of the courthouse wednesday afternoon petitions calling for the judges firing and for the release of the children had more than 2000 signatures thursday afternoon kristen staley associate director of youth justice policy at the michigan council on crime and delinquency said she believed the judge acted within her authority but she said she had concerns about placing nonoffenders in a detention center set up for delinquents ronn torossian a friend of tsimhonis current wife dismissed public anger over the case saying the transcript of last months hearing gives a skewed view of complex divorce proceedings that fill eight volumes this is not a case of these kids would not have a meal with their father so they were sent away torossian said thats ignoring five years in court theres been a lot of inappropriate conduct by the mother throughout the years the divorce case began in 2009 after omer tsimhoni moved to israel each parent claims the other has been dishonest and is trying to take the children omer tsimhonis lawyer contends his exwife violates court orders and doesnt allow the

economy uber will no longer force individual victims of sexual harassment or assault into forced arbitration the ridehailing companys chief legal officer tony west announced in a blog post tuesday morning riders drivers or employees who have been sexually assaulted or discriminated against are free to choose the venue they want to pursue their claims against the company wrote west who was a topranking official in the justice department during the obama administration and has spoken previously about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and gender discrimination its important to give sexual assault and harassment survivors control of how they pursue their claims west wrote in the post noting the companys need to regain the publics trust whatever they decide they will be free to tell their story wherever and however they see fit the move comes less than three weeks after 14 women who said they were sexually assaulted by their uber drivers penned an open letter to the companys board urging it to allow them to pursue justice in an open courtroom rather than in arbitration silencing our stories deprives customers and potential investors from the knowledge that our horrific experiences are part of a widespread problem at uber the women wrote this is not doing the right thing they said alluding to the companys new motto we do the right thing period west who did a stint at pepsico before joining uber credits the new motto in his post on tuesday explaining that in order to actually do the right thing the company must now act with transparency integrity and accountability victims can now decide whether to pursue their case in open court or through mediation or arbitration he wrote and when survivors settle cases with uber the company will no longer require them to remain silent about what happened to them as part of the deal he added uber also said that it would publicly release a safety report that will include data on sexual assaults and other incidents that occur on the uber platform the moves are effective immediately the company said and apply to all cases currently pending against the company those who previously signed nondisclosure agreements will still be bound by those ndas uber ceo dara khosrowshahi recently said that sexual predators often look for a dark corner west wrote our message to the world is that we need to turn the lights on one other tech company microsoft has gotten rid of forced arbitration in harassment lawsuits but ubers move is sure to affect far more people as millions use the service each year on tuesday afternoon ubers closest competitor lyft followed its lead and made a similar announcement today 48 hours prior to an impending lawsuit against their company uber made the good decision to adjust their policies a lyft spokesperson said in an email to huffpost we agree with the changes lyft said it was ending its forced arbitration policy for sexual assault victims whether theyre riders drivers or employees like uber the company would still force class actions into arbitration lyft also said it would no longer require confidentiality in settlement agreements and plans to release data on sexual assaults the company said it did not have an estimate of how much the change will cost and declined to say how many harassment and discrimination cases it has pending ubers new policy only applies to individual cases victims and survivors who wish to band together and bring class action litigation against the company will still be barred from doing so for its part uber contends that the vast majority of the suits filed against it are at the individual level uber also said it now supports federal legislation that would allow individuals to opt out of arbitration in cases of sexual assault and discrimination a bipartisan bill like that was introduced earlier this year with the help of gretchen carlson the former fox news host who was able to sue the companys chairman and ceo despite an arbitration clause in her contract im proud to see companies joining our fight to end arbitration to give more women a voice in harassment and assault cases and unveil the secrecy carlson told huffpost im hopeful more companies will follow suit earlier this year facebook told huffpost it was considering whether to support that legislation and defended its use of arbitration all 50 state attorneys general have expressed support for the bill known as the end arbitration act for sexual harassment in the meantime the fate of many of those womens assault cases is far from clear nine of the 14 women who wrote that open letter are currently suing the company and have asked a california court for classaction status for their case the women will now be free to pursue their assault charges in court but only on an individual level theyre also suing uber for misleading advertising and fraud and the company said those claims would still have to be arbitrated our hope is that uber ending forced arbitration for victims of sexual assault will begin a process to reduce future suffering by women passengers jean christensen the lawyer representing the nine victims uber has made a critical step in this direction but preventing victims from proceeding together on a class basis shows that uber is not fully committed to meaningful change victims are more likely to come forward knowing they can proceed as a group this is the beginning of a longer process needed to meaningfully improve safety moving to disclose data on rapes and sexual assaults is risky for the company west acknowledged in an interview with the new york times he said he struggled with the decision because he knows it will be disturbing according to the times uber is a large company and its fairly easy to lodge a complaint against it also theres no standard on how to report such incidents the company noted uber still hasnt made one key demand tightening its driver background checks by running fingerprints through fbi and doj databases uber has so much money that they are willing to allow customers to sue them in court for what happens to them but they are not willing to make the changes which would make the customers safe said christensen uber disputes the usefulness of fingerprint checks and has pointed out that it has made a raft of changes to tighten up safety over the past year uber also said it will continue to force other disputes into arbitration including when a passenger is injured due to driver negligence ubers reputation took a serious hit in the last several years after a series of public gaffes reports of sexual assaults by drivers that were mishandled and a sexual harassment scandal that felled ubers cofounder and former ceo travis kalanick we remain

entertainment candy cane cupcakes are super festive and fun for the holidays full of peppermint everyone will adore them my son is obsessed with candy canes i honestly dont understand it because i keep a fair amount of sweets in my home i know that some people believe in strictly limiting sugary foods and while i do agree i find that the best way to go about that is to make them readily available as a kid the friends that always seemed to go crazy for candy were the ones who werent allowed to have it i remember one friend sneaking into the bathroom with my moms candy dish hastily stuffing chocolates down her shirt to take home and hide under her bed good grief that stressed me out i wasnt cut out for a life of crime my son jon david who is 10 doesnt get crazy about desserts because hes always been allowed to have them from butterfinger cupcakes and peppermint bark oreos to junior mint cupcakes because hes allowed to have them theyre just not a big deal he likes em he just doesnt go crazy bugging me to eat them i cant tell you how many times ive thrown away halloween or easter candy its to the point where i dont even get him much at holidays because its a waste he does love it but a few pieces do the trick ive never found a secret stash under his bed quite the opposite ive found many a bag of leftover candy from a class party uneaten and going stale for this reason the candy cane obsession is a mystery every year my son insists on hanging them on the christmas tree and every year hes constantly asking if he can eat one of course he never finishes them and i often find half eaten candy canes littered through the house my only guess is that picking them off the tree adds a certain appeal who knows kids are weird kristan is known for her candy creations and hilarity on confessions of a cookbook queen we know where her true genius is though fanciful fanatical cupcake creations

sports everybody is an expert in the days leading up to the nfl draft which kicks off may 8 even those who have no idea how the new format works have strong feelings about whom their team should pick and whom should your team pick whom should they avoid because those who show the most potential sometimes prove to be the biggest disappointments here are a few candidates who need a second thought the good bridgewater ran a prostyle offense at louisville where he was remarkably accurate winning 30 games over the past three years including a memorable performance in the dominant 2013 sugar bowl win against an overhyped florida team but physically bridgewater is a very slight 6foot2 hovering a tad over 200 pounds he isnt especially fast and after not throwing at the combine he had a miserable pro day that left scouts questioning his firstround billing bridgewater doesnt have a big arm or striking leadership abilities but he does boast a better secondhalf quarterback rating when trailing than both johnny manziel and blake bortles but if a quarterback like the new york jets geno smith can go in the early second round bridgewater remains a likely day one pick evans is ranked as the first or second receiver on most national boards at 6foot5 with tremendous ball skills he has the size and physical strength to become a consistent redzone threat among the top 20 wide receiver prospects in the 2014 class he had the highest percentage 254 of passes caught beyond 25 yards per espncom evans proved to be manziels favorite target amassing 69 catches as a redshirt sophomore a lack of frontline speed appears to be his primary drawback he ran the 40 in 453 seconds at the combine which is not bad but doesnt compare to a burner like clemsons sammy watkins the nfl has become an afterthecatch league for wide receivers so evans may well turn into a decent pro but for him to go in the top 10 would be a monumental reach seferianjenkins came to washington three years ago as the topranked tight end recruit in america at 6foot6 he is a colossal human being with excellent feet and big strong hands but somewhere along the way he put on some unnecessary weight and lost his burst as a junior he dropped a ton of balls and didnt show much interest in blocking and while he led all fbs tight ends over the past three seasons with 19 touchdowns inside the 20 he also has a dui arrest to his name as a potential first or secondrounder he screams bust ebron has gotten a lot of attention as a player cast in the jimmy graham mold and he could be a top 15 pick on paper ebron makes a ton of sense he stands 6foot4 plus ran a combine best 46 in the 40 and is a gifted route runner however like graham ebron doesnt block and he didnt dominate in the red zone the way an elite tight end needs to carrs numbers 50 tds 8 interceptions are through the roof but those numbers benefited greatly from the bulldogs style of offense and their slate of opponents but the 6foot2 carr does offer an intriguing skill set he has the arm strength and accuracy just as his brother david does to make some of the toughest throws and derek ran a prostyle offense early in his career under former coach pat hill former nfl head coach and current nfl network analyst steve mariucci told huffpost hes the most proready qb in this draft hes very grounded maybe the best arm in this draft class and climbing the board fast but while hes demonstrated that he has the toughness to play through injury carr seems to struggle with decision making and his footwork when under pressure in the bowl game against usc the only legitimate defense fresno faced all year carr completed a seasonworst 54 percent of his passes and tossed two tds with a pick correction a previous edition of this article incorrectly stated that geno smith was drafted on day one smith was actually drafted 39th overall on day two email me at jordanschultzhuffingtonpostcom or ask me questions about anything sportsrelated at schultzreport and follow me on instagram schultzreport also be sure and catch my nbc sports radio show kup and schultz which airs sunday mornings from 912 et right here
health i am doing absolutely all of my christmas shopping online this year and most of my personal shopping is done online too i pay my bills online i work online this past summer i took a course online except for the fact that i love to travel i really dont need to leave my house anymore i can even order groceries online and have them delivered the one thing that i thought i would always have to leave the house for were my appointments with the personal trainer at my gym well think again he has recently gone online too no matter where i am in my travels we can keep our appointments i have to admit i didnt have a good feeling about this sure it was cheaper but could it be effective my answer is yes yours may not be there are definitely pros and cons to this but they all boil down to the individual among the biggest benefits of having an online personal trainer is that the training sessions are often scheduled via skype or other video conferencing tools video courses of specific exercise plans to suite your needs along with dietary plans in between videoconferences there is regular email communication for questions and issues and always the opportunity for additional videoconferencing unlike the usual gym sessions you can always ask that burning fitness question anytime or ask to have a look at your diet plan for next week the initial conference includes the coughing up of lots of physical information specific information that the client will provide by following instructions for garnering it then the trainer will develop the individual program based on the clients goals for weight and fitness as the program moves forward the client is expected to keep a log of workouts and daily food intake which is shared with the trainer via video conferencing or email one a week access to the best trainers in the world online workout programs been gaining popularity in the last few years and are now named as one of the key fitness trends in 2016 many of the worldclass trainers have gone online so if you want the best and he is in south africa you can now have him and if you are really into a specific fitness category you can now find a personal trainer online who could not be found in your location i have a friend who only wants pilates training she lives in a small town in upstate new york and her perfect trainer is in california easy access to trainer information and evaluation online trainers do advertise and they do belong to clearinghouse networks before you make a choice you can get all kinds of information about them client reviews on social media for example you can access their social media pages and their websites so you really are not making a blind decision a top trainer is often booked solid and as he gets booked you not only wait for an opening you are also going to pay a lot for their time up to 300400 per session if they go online however this may be the cost of a months worth of a program or even two months flexible time and location i travel because i want to others travel for business a lot having online access to your trainer from any location is a pretty big benefit especially if you have questions and dont want to continue with a specific workout until you get an answer and you do not have to wait until you get back home to have your program adjusted support outside of actual training times its hard to get trainers to respond to calls and emails outside of your hour of time with them in fact most wont do it without extra fees online trainers operate differently they are available during reasonable hours and will respond to your calls and emails in my case i was getting replies as early as 600 am and as late as 2300 pm youve probably figured most of these out already but just in case i think its worth reminding of the cons using the wrong technique negates a workout and can even be harmful for this reason most online trainers do use skype and initial video instructions however they cant be with you during each workout session and monitor all your actions possible solution i have practiced recording myself doing an exercise on video and sending that to my trainer for assessment this requires honesty from the client because its easy not to be honest a trainer can only go by the information provided so if a client fudges it is the client who will suffer and an online program wont work so yes youll need a lot of motivation and selfdiligence to make it work for you after all like with any other type of training you need to have a clear vision goals if you want to succeed this is the other element of potential failure clients who meet with their trainer facetoface will be motivated to keep up the program or face the criticism and skipping sessions is so easy when no ones exactly watching you so yep you need to have a huge tone of fitness motivation when you choose to workout online there are some middle grounds between going to the gym and going fully online for instance getting a fitness plan from a personal trainer and nutritionist consultations and using youtube to find video exercises there are plenty of amazing channels to follow some companies are now offering on demand video exercises and guides that are custommade for you it almost seems as if this is a natural extension of the earlier and stillused video workouts and exercise programs that customers order and play at home while they workout taking things to the next level by hiring a remote personal trainer is a bigger commitment it is definitely not for everyone it works for me because

health i was speaking with a good friend the other day she has been going through immense change and selfdiscovery the past few years as with most of us who take that journey it is uncomfortable scary friendchanging often lonely sometimes peaceful very discombobulating but there is a certain point where deep inside you begin to feel the seeds of contentment the knowing of who you really are at your core take hold and reach up from the mud the past eight years has been a whirlwind of change for me my life turned upside down because of my posttraumatic stress disorder and i had to decide both consciously and unconsciously to heal to change or i would most probably die its a sobering thought as i sit down to write this but it was true one day very early on in therapy my therapist and i were discussing the book the alchemist and he asked me to go home and think about what i wanted my personal legend to be and report it back to him in our next session i took that homework very seriously and i decided that my personal legend was to know the entire truth of my past live with my eyes wide open blinders off to continually operate in a place of selfdiscovery growth and change i knew how i was going to meet some of those goals but was at a loss on how i was going to maintain the intention of what i wanted my lifes purpose to look like as i continue to grow and change through time and experience i know the definition of my lifes purpose is who i want to be i know im the author of my own story and i get to choose how i want to be in the world at this point in my life its about choices and being proactive rather than reactive its about aligning my personal values and beliefs with my actions and words while maintaining my integrity selfdiscovery also comes with the knowledge that the truth often hurts and is uncomfortable on many levels including physical spiritual emotional and mental i love that we live in a time where selfdiscovery is an accepted way of life i spent so much time in fear and hiding squelching any dream of a life lived only a life survived now most times i am able to live speak listen and learn from a place of safety and truth discovering the wonder and accepting of life and what it has to offer not getting in the way of who i am and instead letting myself be who i am without my ego reminding me of the should haves did nots or can nots selfdiscovery also comes with the knowledge that the truth often hurts and is uncomfortable on many levels including physical spiritual emotional and mental there were times when i would begin processing a memory and i had to fight not to ignore it or repress it again i learned that by repressing what i had painfully remembered was making a choice to live in fear if i wanted to live my lifes purpose i had to begin to learn to forget how to forget it wasnt an easy path or the path of least resistance but it was the only way i could see to begin to create the life i wanted my ptsd was the catalyst of change for me i had to face certain truths about myself and was forced to look at the direction my life was going was i going to continue to allow my perpetrators to define who i am and how i live my life or do i find the strength to uncover who i really am at my core and how i want to live my life moving forward my illness gave me the choice to put my foot down and say enough is enough i am not going to ride the tide of fortune and misfortune anymore im going to make different choices because i have the power to do so i am resolute on my goal of living with my eyes wide open blinders off to continually operate in a place of selfdiscovery growth and change creating and restructuring my lifes purpose choosing who i want to be is a lifelong ever changing nonlinear journey but its empowering to know that often with each change i grow and emerge stronger than before

progamme supporting rural families and agriculture activities to the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs mobilizing funds and urging greater access to deliver humanitarian aid but crises like these are not gender neutral and thats why the un population fund unfpa plays a critical role in humanitarian response girls boys women and men experience disaster differently girls and women have the least power and status and often at times of crisis their basic needs are deprioritized or neglected and the fulfillment of their essential health and rights including the ability to

worldnews lebanons prime minister saad hariri announced on wednesday that he would be suspending his decision to resign in yet another twist to weeks of confusion and uncertainty in the countrys politics hariri had just arrived in lebanons capital of beirut a day before his first time back in the country after weeks spent mysteriously absent following his surprise announcement that he was stepping down from his post hariri who is an ally of saudi arabia abruptly declared on nov 4 that he was resigning as prime minister a move that created an uproar in lebanon and led to widespread accusations of saudi meddling adding to suspicion over why he was stepping down hariri gave the speech on saudi television while in the nations capital riyadh although hariri tweeted during the absence that he was perfectly fine and reiterated that he would soon return to lebanon from saudi arabia the nature of his resignation has yet to be fully resolved president michel aoun as well as other government officials alleged saudi arabia coerced hariri to quit his post and was holding him hostage even for lebanon which is no stranger to political unrest the crisis around hariris resignation has been a bizarre and concerning development it also threatened to break apart lebanons fragile coalition government which was formed last year to appease the differing national sectarian interests and backers of aoun hariri and the iraniansupported hezbollah militant group saudi arabia for its part has denied any suggestions they were holding hariri against his will or had forced his resignation hariri also rejected any reports he wasnt free to act as he pleases although many lebanese were not convinced in an interview on nov 12 his first televised appearance since the resignation hariri appeared tired and gave meek assurances that everything was ok at one point the prime minister seemed on the verge of tears as he thanked the lebanese public and officials for their concern adding to the public perception that something is amiss hariris abrupt resignation even caught his close aides and associates in lebanon off guard following the speech on nov 4 his allies quickly voiced concern about the prime ministers situation many of them told media outlets in beirut that they were surprised by the resignation they didnt know it was coming said mohamad bazzi an associate professor at new york university and an expert on saudi arabia and irans proxy wars they were also surprised by the language he used how harsh he was to iran and hezbollah saying that it didnt sound like saad hariri it sounded like it was prepared for him hariri claimed during his resignation that hezbollahs and irans disruptive influence in the region frequent saudi grievances were the reasons for his decision hariri also cited a fear of being assassinated saying the political climate was similar to the one before a car bomb killed his thenprime minister father in 2005 saudi arabia and iran have long been mired in a contest to exert their regional power which has escalated in recent years as theyve taken sides in conflicts that include syria and yemen hezbollah which has close ties to iran holds significant influence in lebanon and is wellarmed to carry out military operations the groups prominence in lebanon as well as its role fighting in syrias war has made the country yet another target for saudi arabia as it seeks to limit iranian power it seems that the saudi leadership concluded that hariri wasnt capable of being tough on hezbollah in the way they wanted him to be and they decided to give up on him bazzi said hariris resignation announcement also came on the same weekend that saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman moved to consolidate power in his country detaining many of the countrys most powerful figures as part of a vague anticorruption push saudi officials around this time also declared lebanon a hostile state its unclear exactly what connection the timing of saudi arabias purge has to do with hariris resignation although both are part of the growing trend of saudi leadership taking aggressive action in an attempt to shape both domestic and foreign politics this has been met with approval from president donald trump who tweeted his apparent support for the saudi purge and has signaled that the us is willing to give saudi arabia a free hand on such actions as hariris absence from lebanon stretched on more politicians were drawn into the crisis and demanded his prompt return hezbollah leader and hariri rival sayyed hassan nasrallah called for saudi arabia to release the prime minister last week and president aoun called the suspected detention an act of aggression the lebanese public too became increasingly concerned with the whereabouts of their prime minister at the countrys annual marathon in beirut on nov 12 runners wore tshirts with prohariri slogans calling for his return some carried signs with hariris face and the caption we want our pm back while billboards in the city featured similar messages ultimately it looks like the saudi leaders miscalculated how this would play out there was a strong groundswell of support for hariri both from the sunni community and also from hezbollah which the saudis may not have expected bazzi said what ended up happening was that the saudis alienated even their base of support in lebanon french president emmanuel macron also got involved announcing on nov 15 that hariri and his family would come to visit macron in france macron was careful to note however that hariris visit was not an offer of exile to the lebanese president french foreign minister jeanyves le drian arrived in riyadh on nov15 in an attempt to moderate the situation last friday a member of parliament for hariris political party confirmed that hariri would travel to france at some point that same day but the mp omar saqr created more confusion when he said that hariri would not be immediately returning to lebanon after the trip however and instead would go on a small arab tour we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank

worldnews ratanpura lake on the outskirts of ahmedabad gujarat has almost completely dried up asit k biswas national university of singapore cecilia tortajada national university of singapore and udisha saklani over the past three years the monsoon the rainy season that runs from june through september depending on the region has been weak or delayed across much of india causing widespread water shortages with the onset of summer this year southern india particularly karnataka kerala and tamil nadu states are already wilting under a blistering sun and repeated heatwaves drought is expected to affect at least eight states in 2017 which is a devastating possibility in a country where agriculture accounted for 175 of gdp in 2015 and provides the livelihood for nearly half the population across rural india water bodies including manmade lakes and reservoirs are fast disappearing after decades of neglect and pollution they have drained out the water and converted the land into a plot for schools dispensaries and other construction activities manoj misra of the ngo yamuna jiye abhiyan warned in the hindu newspaper as far back as 2012 it wasnt always this way for the past 2500 years india has managed its water needs by increasing supply prior to industrialisation and the accompanying global green revolution in the 1960s which saw the development of highyield variety crops using new technologies indias water availability was plentiful households industries and farmers freely extracted groundwater and dumped untreated waste into waterways without a second thought but such practices are now increasingly untenable in this rapidly growing country per capita availability of water has been steadily falling for over a decade dropping from 1816 cubic metres per person in 2001 to 1545 cubic metres in 2011 the decline is projected to deepen in coming years as the population grows india which currently has 13 billion people is set to overtake china by 2022 and reach 17 billion in 2050 water scarcity is also exacerbated by a growth in waterintensive industries such as thermal power production extraction and mining as india seeks to feed and power its growing population in addition to affecting biodiversity these activities also alter natural water systems still successive governments have pursued the same old supplycentric policies paying little heed to the countrys waning clean water supplies for nearly 50 years a misguided groundwater policy has sucked india dry water tables have declined by an average of one metre every three years in some parts of the indus basin turning it into the second most overstressed aquifer in the world according to nasa across nearly the whole country basic sewage management is also lacking according to the third world centre for water management only about 10 of waste water in the country is collected and properly treated as a result all water bodies in and around urban centres are seriously polluted today the country is struggling to provide safe drinking water to every citizen even so residents of new delhi or kolkata today use more than twice as much water on average than people in singapore leipzig barcelona or zaragoza according to data compiled by the third world research centre the water use in delhi is 220 litres per capita per day lpcd while some european cities boast figures of 95 to 120 lpcd excess consumption is attributable in part to citizen indifference about conserving water after so many years of plentiful supply since large swaths of many indian megacities lack piped supply of clean water leaks and theft are common cities in india lose 40 to 50 due to leakages and nonauthorised connections at this point the only viable option for india would seem to be managing demand and using water more efficiently the country is making tentative steps in that direction the 2016 new national water framework passed emphasises the need for conservation and more efficient water use but under indias constitution states are responsible for managing water so central policies have little resonance neither the 1987 and 2012 national water policy documents which contained similar recommendations to the 2016 policy had any real impact on water use and after millennia of exclusive focus on expanding the water supply the idea of curbing water consumption and increase reuse remains a mostly alien concept in india consistent supplycentric thinking has also resulted in competition for water as states negotiate the allocation of river water based on local needs indias interstate disputes on water usage have reached a critical point the centurylong conflict over the cauvery river for example involves andhra pradesh tamil nadu karnataka three major south indian states with each state demanding ever more water the river simply cannot keep up in karnataka where agricultural policies are heavily skewed towards waterguzzling commercial crops such as sugarcane mismanaged ground and surface water are dying a slow death still the state continues to petition the cauvery water dispute tribunal for an increase in its share water scarcity in karnataka is aggravated by nonexistent water quality management its rivers are choked with toxic pollutants and oilsuffused lakes in bengaluru the capital are reportedly catching fire meanwhile in the northern part of the country the ravibeas river is causing conflict between punjab and haryana states in indias water wars rivers are a resource to be harnessed and extracted for each riparian partys maximum benefit very little emphasis has been placed on conserving and protecting existing water sources and not one interstate negotiation has prioritised pollution abatement or demand management even policies from the national government which claims to target water conservation and demand management remain reliant on supplyside solutions big infrastructure programs such as the indian riverlinking plan envision largescale water transfer from one river basin to another again seeking to augment supply rather than conserve water and reduce consumption sand mining on the cauvery river in 2017 for inspiration on managing demand india could look to berlin in germany singapore and california all of which have designed and implemented such policies in recent years successful measures include raising public awareness recycling water fixing leaks preventing theft and implementing conservation measures such as water harvesting and stormwater management we remain committed to providing you

health i cannot profess to know why ketogenic diets are the flavor of the week other than the fact that there always is one of those ever in the interest of those selling them and almost never in the interest of those buying there is some fairly new and quite rudimentary research on the topic that might be the reason for the current infatuation but the pop culture claims are wildly at odds with those data to say nothing of the overall weight of scientific evidence regarding diet and health whatever the reasons legions seem poised to toast 2017 goodbye and welcome 2018 with ketogenic koolaid and i consider them dangerously mistaken before you join their misguided ranks i suggest we drain this topic to its lowcarb dregs and see where it leaves us the historical case for ketogenesis denying the body its customary fuel sources so that glucose is in short supply and instead it metabolizes fat preferentially and generates ketone bodies as fuel resides in starvation rather predictably starvation has profound effects on all aspects of metabolism the body effectively turns to autodigestion to sustain itself during a protracted fast fat and protein stores in the body are converted to fuel and metabolism then does run on ketone bodies in this modern age of epidemic obesity and type 2 diabetes starvation has acquired a patina of merit during starvation blood sugar falls blood insulin falls blood cholesterol falls blood pressure falls weight declines none of these were desirable throughout most of humanitys subsistence but all cry out benefit in this era of diseasebyexcess but alas starvation has its drawbacks among them the tendency to be fatal when the body autodigests it is somewhat indiscriminate and proteins can be leached even from vital organs such as the heart that can disrupt microarchitecture which can in turn disrupt electrical signaling and that can and does cause fatal dysrhythmias the first attempt to mimic the benefits of starvation medically and thus arguably the fist ancestor to the current fixation on ketogenesis was very low calorie liquid dietsvlcds these had the same drawback as actual starvation periodic death by dysrhythmia and have long since taken their place in the dust bin of bad ideas starvation then is a dubious proposition but the appeal of its metabolic advantages in modern context persists this tension has propagated an ongoing quest to secure the metabolic advantages of starvation without the pesky inconveniences of actually starving and risking sudden cardiac death the initial successful result of this effort was calorie restriction or cr or in another variant the proteinsparing modified fast cr reduces calories to a level that imposes many of the effects of starvation however cr involves the very careful delivery of essential nutrients including key proteins so that the body does not autodigest its own vital organs hence protein sparing cr like starvation is ketogenic achieving that effect not by restricting carbohydrate but by restricting total calories most approaches to cr are in fact ketogenic despite being high in total carbohydrate from particularly nutrientrich foods notably vegetables fruits beans and legumes a primary principle of cr is to compensate for lowcalorie intake with reliance on the foods richest in valuable nutrients cr is associated with certain liabilities such as infertility but appears to enhance longevity this is clear in many species other than our own and suggested for our own but cr involves something akin to gentle starvation every day so there is a joke about it maybe it makes you live forever or maybe it just feels like forever this then is where the newage idea of ketogenic diets was incubated the current hope is to have your cr benefits but eat those calories too by restricting all carbohydrate sources the body can be forced to run on ketone bodies even in the absence of semistarvation there is a very serious problem with this concept however before we turn to the matter of evidence the ketogenic diet idea makes the huge leap of faith that ketone bodies per se can confer health benefit the work the idea is born from however establishes nothing of the sort starvation involves not just ketone bodies but starvation and is overall a very bad idea for the healthconscious cr might be a good idea at least for healthconscious masochists but its benefits are decisively linked to lowintake of calories and highintake of nutrient rich plant foods ketone body generation just comes along for the ride what evidence is there that cr can be replaced with carbohydrate restriction that nutrientrich plant foods can be mostly or entirely displaced by meat and the health or longevity benefits of cr themselves less than entirely proven replicated to the best of my knowledge in humans absolutely none zero the one known benefit of ketogenic diets is for the shortterm control of otherwise intractable seizures mostly in certain children there are as noted shortterm studies of ketogenic diets showing the usual metabolic benefits attached to almost any diet replacing the prevailing state of ingestive anarchy with some kind of discipline reduced blood sugar blood cholesterol blood pressure and weight but lest you think shortterm improvements in these markers a good idea makes consider these other interventions that do the same a bout of cholera a crack cocaine binge the spread of cancer through ones body or the advance of tuberculosis the historical name for tuberculosis consumption connotes exactly such effects the infection eats away at you many lifethreatening diseases evoke autodigestion and cause weight cholesterol glucose insulin and blood pressure to fall they are all emphatically illadvised just the same perhaps the currently popular approach to ketogenic diets is a case apart but the burden is on those making the claim to prove it not on the rest of us to disprove it they have a steep hill to climb we have reason to wonder if the shortterm consumption of ketogenesis turns into all the perks of a wasting disease over time for those rare individuals who can stick with it there is for starters no evidence that ketogenic diets are conducive to or even compatible with human health across the lifespan or longevity there is instead bountiful evidence that the very foods such diets exclude are associated with less diabetes cancer heart disease dementia and premature death in general there is as well the experience of freeliving populations to date every population group around the world found to experience remarkable vitality and longevity has a dietary pattern in which whole nutrientrich plant foods predominate the very opposite of ketogenic vitality and longevity even in the last of the planets huntergatherers or foragers is similarly linked to a plantpredominant highcarbohydrate diet so ok ketogenic diets might help people live long and prosper but there are to date no such people admittedly the inuit for want of choice have a very lowcarbohydrate diet which may at times be ketogenic but they do not experience enviable health or longevity there is as well the inconvenience factor of being on a diet for the rest of ones life the argument for ketogenic diets reeks of fad because like all fad diets the benefits derive from eliminating most of the foods most people around the world like to eat if ever there was a case of fool me once shame on you fool me 10000 times shame on me the marketing of the next diet fad is surely it arguments for ketogenesis as anything other than the next batch of koolaid brewed specially for suckers need to navigate past all such impediments there is more however while such diets are likely to be harmful to the health of people they are certain to be devastating to the fate of the planet the clamor for ketogenic diets is at odds with every trend necessary to preserve our aquifers wild places biodiversity and climate so maybe a diet low in vegetables fruits whole grains beans lentils nuts and seeds a diet low in antioxidants and phytonutrients and devoid of fiber could be good for you in spite of it all if you are reaching for your credit card accordingly you should understand you are paying for the privilege of making a leap of faith time will tell about the landing as for those peddling the concept of ketogenic diets so absurdly beyond the basis for it in any evidence there are only two explanations either they have drunk deeply of their own lowcarb koolaid and are themselves deluded or they are selling the stuff to you but know not to buy it in which case they are profiteering hypocrites the expansive market for fatuous diets provides abundant cover for both species as i write this the proposed guiding principles for healthy eating in canada have just been released they are eminently sensible current and evidencebased so naturally they are under immediate attack as was the comparably sensible 2015 report of the dietary guidelines advisory committee here in the us before ever its ink was dry the beef and dairy industries oppose the movement toward more wholefood plantpredominant diets so decisively associated with better health outcomes for people and planet alike they would be more than glad to toast 2017 on its way with ketogenic koolaid the likelihood however that they are toasting to your good health in 2018 let alone that of the planet is very remote indeed i do so wishing you a happy new year and the boon of prudent choices author disclosure statement a recent provocative article in jama called on all scholars addressing diet to disclose their own position practice and interests accordingly i note that i am a lifelong advocate of minimally processed plantpredominant diets on the basis of relevant evidence i have reviewed directly i practice such a diet personally i do not have a financial interest in any specific kind of diet but i do inevitably have a financial interest in advancing what i consider to be the truth about diet and health since all of my professional activities are devoted to that mission director yale

health 2013 has arrived and with it my yearly list of foods you may want to consider adding or have more of this year all of them have been around for ages but like clothing music and celebrities certain foods come and go in terms of popularity here are 13 that may help you improve your health assist your weightloss efforts or just give you the chance to give your taste buds something new black rice if white rice is a staple in your diet youre missing out on a whole new rice world black rice has been around for thousands of years but only now getting the attention it deserves evidence suggests that black rice may have more cancerfighting antioxidants than blueberries or blackberries its also loaded with fiber and bvitamins apricots orange is in and the orange in these tasty treats come from betacarotene a powerhouse carotenoid that converts to vitamin a in the body a recent study found that low levels of betacarotene are associated with dementia soy soy has remained one of the most controversial foods of the past few years but the truth is it really shouldnt be thats because the overwhelming amount of evidence for soy shows beneficial as opposed to adverse health effects soy may play a role in lowering blood pressure early intake of soy in life appears to play a protective role against breast cancer and some studies now indicate that consistent soy intake may actually help to decrease the recurrence of breast cancer among certain patient populations they key howeverin attaining these benefits is to focus on whole soy foods such as miso tempeh tofu and soybeans that means your soy chips and that soy energy bar may not cut it purple potatoes if you think all potatoes are the downfall to your weightloss plans think again a recent study in the journal of agricultural and food chemistry found that eating a moderate serving of purples potatoes twice a day helped to lower blood pressure in obese individuals without causing weight gain additionally the more color a fruit or vegetable has the better it is for you thats because vibrant hues in whole foods are created by powerful phytochomeicals that help to reduce inflammation and overall disease risk tortilla chips do you often find yourself looking for something crunchy and savory midway through the afternoon but dont want to have yet another fatfree snack that fails to fill you up tortilla chips may be just what youre looking for they are 100 percent whole grain and a good source of fiber but perhaps the most impressive fact about this simple snack is that they are in a word simple that means many tortilla chip options at the stores have only two or three ingredients a far cry from some of the competitive chip offerings on the shelf that can contain more than 10 ingredients if you are a diplover pair it with salsa or hummus for extra nutrients without the aging fat that other dips think french onion cheese etc tend to supply horseradish looking for a condiment that will give kick to your food while kicking cancer risk as well then turn up the heat in 2013 by adding some horseradish to a sandwich or salad dressing the horseradish plant is from the same family as cancerfighting superstars broccoli cabbage kale and cauliflower two studies in 2012 found that horseradish contained high amounts of glucosinolate a natural compound that has been found to be a powerful dietary ally in cancer prevention blackberries move over blueberries blackberries may have you beat blackberries have been found in one study to be higher in antioxidants than their blue counterparts while both berries are fabulous in terms of fighting off disease blackberries are often the understudy to blueberries this year why not make them center stage their antiinflammatory effects not only may help to prevent cancer but may do wonders for your skin as well black beans so many fabulous nutrients stored in such a small little bean this plantbased source of protein is high in fiber and iron giving new meaning to the term nutrient density and making it a dream food staple for individuals hoping to shed a few pounds bran bran its not just for the constipated brans of any kind corn rice wheat and oat are loaded with fiber about 12 grams per serving and if you thought fiber was only good for cleaning out the digestive pipes youre missing out on a lot more benefits studies have shown that fiber may help to reduce the progression of prostate cancer in mice promote gastrointestinal health and reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke by helping in the fight toward lower cholesterol mix bran into muffins yogurt or even soups to get a fiber boost pears with new and exciting super fruits being introduced to the market sometimes its easy to forget that some simple fruit staples are still some of the best pears are high in fiber and vitamin c and may be a perfect snack if your new years resolution is to reduce your risk of cancer a study in 2009 found that pears may help reduce the incidence of gastric cancer by decreasing bile acids in the intestinal tract onions onions are not only a great way to add taste to your meals but may also help to reduce your risk of stroke as well a 2012 animal study in the journal of clinical investigation found that a flavanoid known as rutin found in fruits vegetables and teas helped to reduce the formation of blood clots roti love indian food but dont love the fact that you typically eat three pieces of white flour naan at your favorite restaurants next time choose a better and healthier indian bread roti found at all indian restaurants roti provides something thats hard to find when youre dining out a 100 percent wholegrain bread option enjoy roti over the white rice to soak up those delicious indian sauces youll get lots of health benefits and may avoid the aftermeal bloat as well black pepper a few sprinkles of black pepper not only adds great flavor to your foods it may also help to block fat a 2012 study in the journal of agricultural and food chemistry found that a compound in pepper known as piperine helped to block the formation of fat cells in the body if youre going to spice up your food why not choose something

entertainment as this is posted jackie and i have just come to the end of a tooshort trip to sicily and naples where we hadnt been for probably twenty or twentyfive years we ate so many delicious things mostly traditional dishes but a few more creative ones too that its hard to decide what to report on ill pick just a few that will be joining or at least influencing the home cooking repertoire back in new york we arrived in naples from sicily too late for dinner restaurants were open but we were airplaneweary so along with the friend we were traveling with we went up to the roof terrace of our hotel the excellent hotel excelsior where well certainly stay next time were in town to have a couple of negronis and gaze down at the boats assembling for the annual three gulfs race the drinks hit the spot and they came with a bowl of crunchy ringshaped taralli if youd had only taralli out of a cellophane bag or from an oldtime neighborhood bakery you might have ignored these in favor of the mixed nuts but that would have been a mistake because neapolitan taralli are a very different thing theyre crisp and slightly crumbly they are tonguetinglingly peppery they have toasted almonds in them and most important they are made with good lard rubbed into the flour as youd make a pie dough ill need to collate some of the dozens of available recipes and conduct a few experiments but taralli napoletani are certainly going to be offered with drinks at our house and soon also in naples at the restaurant ecomesar one of the antipasti was a torta of eggplant a flared mold lined with cooked eggplant and filled with more eggplant tomatoes and cheese it had all the flavor and all the flavors of eggplant parmigiana but in an easily served and easily eaten format we wont be back in new york for another week and i think it is too much to hope that therell be eggplants in the farmers market but as soon as they appear ill get cracking on this neat alternative to a parmigiana in noto sicily we had dinner at the stylish ristorante crocifisso where a thick swordfish steak was crusted with herbandcitrusscented breadcrumbs the coating itself was nothing new ive used similar things with fish in the past but for lack of imagination id never thought of swordfish as a candidate for breading and i shall give it a whirl probably starting it over a medium flame then transferring it to a hot oven i just hope i can find a piece of swordfish as fatty as the one marco baglieri the chef served and keep it as moist as he did our italian trip had started in palermo where on our final evening we had a dinner marred by mostly tired food and consistently tired service the only time we encountered this but among the antipasti was a real jewel floured and fried small sardines but with a twist theyd been briefly marinated in vinegar before dredging long enough to add zest and slightly alter the texture but not so long that they were sour or dry we tend to get lousy sardines in new york but ill try doing this with little mackerels and thats only the start isnt travel great

to clarify how it uses that data in the first place at the same time facebook also increased its estimate of users whose data was harvested and shared with the political research firm cambridge analytica from 50 million to as many as 87 million needless to say there was plenty to talk about heres a brief rundown of the bigger points of the conversation zuckerberg said he expects the company will revise and reassess the extent of russias misinformation campaign and that its numbers will undoubtedly grow there is going to be more content that were going to find over time he said as long as there are people employed in russia who have the job of trying to find a way to exploit these systems this is going to be a neverending battle you never fully solve security its an arms race he acknowledged facebook was behind during the 2016 election and said the company plans to hire 20000 people by the end of the year to focus on content screening and security efforts there hasnt been any meaningful impact by the movement he said but the company does take seriously the underlying sentiment thats driving it even if we cant measure a change it still speaks to people feeling like this is a massive breach of trust facebook took cambridge analytica at its word that the company had in fact deleted the data harvested from up to 87 million users and maybe it should have followed up to verify it was actually deleted zuckerberg didnt rule out the possibility of legal action against cambridge analytica but said facebook will do a full audit first to determine what happened to the data and when that said he acknowledged facebook cant just pass the blame onto cambridge analytica as facebooks tools enabled its behavior in the first place i think we understand that we need to take a broader view of our responsibility zuckerberg said were not just building tools but we need to take full responsibility for the outcomes of how people use those tools as well knowing what i know today clearly we shouldve done more and we will going forward hes into it with some reservations asked specifically if hed be willing to implement new privacy policies in the us similar to the strict new privacy laws rolling out in the european union zuckerberg said he was comfortable with the idea but not in the same format when the eu law takes effect on may 25 facebook will have to get users explicit consent to collect data and be much more upfront about how it uses that data zuckerberg said facebook intends to make the same controls and settings available everywhere not just in europe thats subject to some flexibility however a variation he attributed to a patchwork of global laws on the matter two reporters asked variations of this question and it seemingly caught him off guard the first time the second time he unhesitatingly said yes portraying the companys recent stumbles more as learning opportunities than farreaching mistakes when youre building something like facebook that is unprecedented in the world there are going to be things that you mess up and if wed gotten this right we wouldve messed something else up i dont think anyone is going to be perfect but i think what people should hold us accountable for is learning from the mistakes and continually doing better and continuing to evolve what our view of our responsibility is nope zuckerberg disputed the premise of the question portraying a more profitable facebook as one thats fundamentally more useful to people as the site gets better at targeting users with morerelevant ads the more profitable it will be people tell us that if theyre going to see ads they want the ads to be good like most of the hard decisions we have to make this is one where theres a tradeoff between values that people care about on the one hand people want relevant experiences and on the other hand i do think theres some discomfort with how data is used in systems like ads but i think the feedback is overwhelmingly on the side of wanting a better experience zuckerberg broke this into three distinct categories each to be combated via different initiatives by the company we remain committed to providing you with the

sensationalistic fake stories people click the stories spread rapidly despite being false and the author often located in macedonia makes money simple artificial intelligence measures have helped curb this type of economically driven content the second category belongs to russian agents and other government actors who are interfering with and attempting to influence the outcome of an election zuckerberg acknowledged this is more difficult to combat especially because it mimics and can be indistinguishable from legitimate political discussion facebook is making progress here with moderate successes in the french and german elections but zuckerberg cautioned it will be a multiyear effort and the third category he identified tracks back to political polarization in society itself that shows up on facebook when highly biased media outlets present a larger picture that isnt really true even if the specific facts might be zuckerberg said the site is seeking to counter by promoting broadly trusted journalism that does a fair and thorough job

health we need some new truth about an old issue most people suffer needlessly from a complete misconception about what life balance is i was asked not long ago to give a talk on life and work balance ive been serving business groups as a philosopher and public speaker for over 25 years and it was the first time anyone had asked me about that topic i was told that the executives and managers in the organization id be speaking to were stressed and pushed and pulled in so many different ways and needed to take a breath and get their bearings they felt like they were living unbalanced lives i did what i always do when requested to speak on a new topic i first pondered the wisdom of the ages and then looked into my own experience i talked to people whose sagacity i admire and i dug deep to analyze the issue at the most fundamental level i could on this occasion as i began pondering the topic i recalled something important right away when i was a kid i once saw on television the worlds most famous highwire artist walking a tightrope he was reputedly so great that i expected to see him strolling the tightlystretched cable the way you or i would make our way across a wide carpeted floor but what i saw surprised me the camera did a close up as he made his way across the rope his feet were always in motion seemingly out of balance at nearly every second jerking to the left then to the right correcting back left lurching then right wiggling shaking shimmying and stepping forward i was seeing not the smooth gliding or simple confident footfalls i had expected but instead a constant flurry of movement and countermovement the mans arms were in motion his whole body was undergoing a dance of continuous correction and adjustment remembering this unexpected sight years later and reflecting on it i came to realize something important just as there are no perfectly smooth surfaces in this world no perfect spheres no absolutely straight lines all geometers abstractions theres also no such thing as perfect balance the gymnast or yoga practitioner standing on one foot with what seems like perfect balance actually has a body thats in constant fine motor adjustment twitching muscles and correcting for miniscule displacements that we cant see were all like the tightrope walker were always a little out of balance in some way or another the key to real life balance is constant adjustment correction and forward movement life balance isnt static its dynamic and everchanging youre spending too much time at work ok then change spend more time with family and friends break the habits that may recently have dominated your life or it could be that youre spending too much time away from work enjoying your hobbies and the closest people in your life to the exclusion of things you need to get done well then simply adjust in a contrary way dont get all balled up in guilt about it just change adapt alter turn it around too many people when working hard feel bad that theyre not at home or worry when theyre at home that theyre not in the office or on the laptop or ipad working they never fully enjoy what theyre doing but are always concerned about what they could or maybe should be doing instead theyre not present and this is no way to live or work we should monitor ourselves for when we might be getting a little out of balance and then do something about it regret remorse and guilt accomplish little in issues of balance if you feel any one of those emotions and you think its a legitimate warning signal just let it motivate you to change then youll likely soon have to change again but dont despair of being out of balance most of us are most of the time its the dance of adjustment and adaptation that constitutes the real process of balancing over time to put it another way balance isnt to be found at a moment in time but only across or through stretches of time its a process that could be better represented in a video not a state of being that could be shown in a snapshot and what constitutes proper balance will vary to some extent person to person plus it can vary within your own life from one season to another one phase to the next dont let the past define your present or your future your process of balancing things as a young parent will be different from what it was as a single professional new to the workforce your life balance as a senior executive may look very different from it did when you were a younger hungry upwardlybound achiever life hands us different challenges at different times and we are challenged to respond in a way thats distinctively proper to that challenge and time the different stages of life call for different adaptations but each allows for the dance of balance balance is one of those concepts best thought of in terms of the verb not the noun or to put it differently the verb is primary and fundamental the noun is secondary and abstractive the ongoing action of balancing is our main concern the result of balance is always to some extent an ideal toward which we move and in whose light we see what needs to be done now this is a liberating conception of balance but its not meant to be an excuse if your significant other or best friend tells you that your life is way out of balance its no good to reply merely that perfect balance is not an option however impossible perfection might be in this particular life issue there are clearly degrees of better and worse and there are actions we can take at almost any time to improve the process as a whole so the next time you feel out of balance remember the tightrope walker and adjust those who dont do so are going to fall off the rope and theres not always a safety net below for more on emotional wellness click here
technology facebook is changing your news feed in a good way on thursday facebook announced a change to its news feed instead of passively following the glut of content selected by the sites algorithm now users can pick a few dozen friends and pages to prioritize what appears at the top of their news feed it seems like a simple update until you consider how much power facebooks news feed algorithm has over what we read in 2014 facebook was responsible for about a quarter of all traffic across the entire web that means that almost onefourth of the time that people came to a website they came from facebookcom aside from status updates and baby photos facebook has become an important source for information and news nearly half of americans with internet access use facebook to read news about politics and government according to a 2014 pew poll about as many as followed local television and the news feed is the central hub of the facebook referral service a hub that is increasingly becoming the way americans get information but facebooks news feed has always been a passive experience with the sites algorithm determining what its users see the idea that facebook should be the arbiter of whats important to its users started with the news feeds origin story when according to david kirkpatricks book the facebook effect ceo mark zuckerberg justified using an algorithm in the service of users a squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in africa the problem for those who might find their interests more piqued by africa than pest control is theres no clear way to override the algorithm other than clicking on the kind of content you want to see and hoping for the best its a nannying stance that the company continues to espouse most recently in an interview this week for time with adam mosseri facebooks news feed product management director a purely chronological feed he said would be bad for users because people would miss a lot more important content our whole mission is to show people content that we think that they find meaningful determining what facebook thinks interests its users has become make or break for publishers some companies like upworthy and mashable draw in readers by gaming the facebook algorithm others like the new york times and buzzfeed have begun hosting their content directly on facebook and regardless of how well sites are able to game the algorithm everyone is vulnerable to shifts in facebooks policies when the company announced in april that it would prioritize content from users friends over that from pages it sent digital publishers into a panic in february facebooks top 10 publishers saw a huge drop in traffic referrals which was later attributed to a news feed bug but the message it sent was clear just as easily as facebook can send traffic to a site it can also take that traffic away these effects were highlighted in a study published by two facebook employees in the research journal science this may the researchers found that the algorithm limits crosscutting news stories that take the opposite political stance to a users selfidentification eliminating 8 percent of oppositional news stories for liberals and 5 percent for conservatives users choices were also found to limit this crosscutting content on thursday afternoon zuckerberg announced the news feed update on his personal page our goal is to help you connect with the people and things you care about the most he wrote though the shift doesnt fix the problems with the facebook algorithm for the first time it makes a portion of the feed transparent giving users a margin of accountability over what they read prioritize pages about squirrels favorite a bunch of news sites about africa for now at least its marginally up to you

science if you ask a neuroscientist to show you a map of the brain chances are theyll pick one thats more than a century old in 1909 a german anatomist named korbinian brodmann published an intricate map of the brains surface he painstakingly stained brain cells of many kinds to find the anatomical features that set them apart and the rules that governed their layered organization we now know that neurons that sense a touch on the skin are found in brodmann area 1 those allowing you to read this article sit in area 17 now scientists have built an updated map of the brain that further refines those areas published wednesday in the journal nature the map reveals 97 previously unknown areas of the brains surface the cortex in addition to 83 areas that were described before unlike brodmanns and other brain maps built using just one property how the cells looked under a microscope for example the new atlas is made by combining several types of data that capture multiple properties of these brain areas their anatomy their function and the connections between them the data was gathered using multiple noninvasive brain imaging measures from 210 people in the nih human connectome project and the accuracy of the resulting map was confirmed on another group of 210 people the study authors hope that researchers who have previously used brodmanns map to identify brain areas will use this new map from the human connectome project instead said matthew glasser of washington university in st louis the studys lead author according to glasser and his colleagues at six other research centers combining anatomical data with functional data from fmri brain scans has allowed for more precise delineation between brain areas for example an area that may look indistinguishable from its neighbor under the microscope or on mri scans may light up on fmri scans that measure brain activation during a specific mental task and thus stand out as a distinct region the situation is analogous to astronomy where groundbased telescopes produced relatively blurry images of the sky before the advent of adaptive optics and space telescopes glasser said in a press release researchers hope that a more precise division of the brain can prevent potential confusion in neuroscience studies that may be looking at overly broad areas and lead to new discoveries the map is a longawaited advance said b t thomas yeo and simon eickhoff two neuroscientists not involved in the study in an accompanying article in nature they added that it creates a reference atlas that allows neuroscientists studying various aspects of the brain to work within a common framework we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again this article has been updated to include a comment from matthew glasser

sports generally sports broadcasters ignore fans who run onto the field during games perhaps hoping not to encourage copycats however most people who storm the field dont actually run directly into a play in progress this fan at a game between florida state and miami on saturday night worked his way onto the field and found himself right in the middle of the action in this case the broadcasters and the players had no choice but to talk about the interloper i just looked at him and i stepped away miami linebacker denzel perryman told the sunsentinel at first i was going to take him down but then i was like nah whatever seeing as how this guy managed to weave his way through all these players perhaps he has a future as a running back in some south florida prison league according to the miami herald the fan was arrested

health a debate is quietly raging in the medical community on the value of having an annual physical most likely because next year millions of soontobeinsured americans will be required under obamacare aka the affordable care act to receive annual checkups today i am sitting on an examination table covered in hard waxy paper in the medical office of dr robert thomas in coral gables i have just had my blood drawn and i am waiting to be seen for my annual physical being a lawyer in miami who sues doctors and hospitals has given me years of experience in analyzing and investigating potential medical neglect cases i have learned that a majority of the cases involving failures to diagnose a given illness or condition were defensible because while the diagnosis may have been made late the disease was too far along for intervention to have made any difference in the outcome this is called causation and it is one of the three necessary elements and often the most difficult element required to prove any potential medical malpractice case against a hospital or doctor the three elements of a medical malpractice case 1 negligence or a mistake did the health care provider actually make a mistake in the manner of care provided to the patient this includes what the physician nurse or midwife actually did or did not do in a given circumstance while this would seem obvious medicine is open to multiple interpretations as to what is appropriate for a given patient in a given circumstance appropriate care is defined as the standard of care but rarely if ever is there an agreed upon standard of care amongst health care providers especially one that can be relied upon in evaluating a potential malpractice case 2 causation did the alleged mistake or neglect actually cause a particular change in the patients prognosis or outcome this is the point of my blog today and the reason i frequent my doctors office for periodic physical and diagnostic testing i know from experience that the sooner a disease can be diagnosed the sooner it can be treated and the sooner treatment can be started the more likely a positive outcome can be effected from personal experience and for the benefit of my readers i recommend that you seek a qualified and boardcertified internal medicine physician whom you like and trust the annual examination should include the following at a minimum but my physician does even more a blood work b blood pressure c temperature d review of family history e discussion of any changes in your medical condition f review of detrimental lifestyles choices such as smoking alcohol drug use or abuse diet and exercise etc in the context of a medical malpractice case i have reviewed many circumstances that indicated a particular failure by a clients surgeon or radiologist in identifying a medical condition but found that the delay in ultimately recognizing that failure may have done little or nothing to change the outcome this can be best illustrated by stroke cases i have represented a number of people who have presented to an emergency room or urgent care center with the obvious signs and symptoms of a stroke however if the patient presents outside the window of time when interventional medications or surgery can be given the outcome is usually not going to be any different even though the initial diagnosis was wrong 3 the third element is damages this means that one must first prove the mistake caused some damage sometimes in a medical malpractice case even the worse mistakes can be resolved this is particularly true in botched plastic or cosmetic surgery cases i have seen situations where patients have been left with horrific and seemingly permanent disfigurements after undergoing a breast augmentation or tummy tuck yet with time and the skill of a competent reconstructive surgeon they can be made to look as good as new and often better the point of this post is to illustrate how medical malpractice law works in an effort to motivate you to receive at least a yearly physical and blood work and to encourage you to focus on disease prevention and health optimization and for those without insurance when next years affordable care act takes effect some 30 million people will be added to the roster of the medically insured and become eligible for governmentmandated preventive care through annual health exams i respectfully disagree with the critics of annual exams those who challenge the axiom that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure when they argue that the added burden and cost to our health care system outweigh any benefit they can cite a recent study published by the prestigious bmj formerly the british medical journal which found that general health checks did not reduce morbidity or mortality neither overall nor for cardiovascular or cancer causes instead i recommend that it is far better to be safe than sorry the doctor will see me now for more by spencer aronfeld click here

island pulverized by nature everybody says leave leave and go where blatch asked my plan is to rebuild this island i have a lot to offer unlike almost every other home on abaco blatchs house had little damage he is a builder who prides himself on quality work when mixing concrete he never skimps always precisely blending the recommended amounts of cement sand and gravel for floors columns and ceilings when he poured his walls and floors he laced them thick with rebar constructing a powerful skeleton that resisted the storm instead of using the manufacturerprovided clips on his hurricane shutters he used long screws on as many as possible to fix the shutters tight to the window frame when dorian hit it only managed to rip away the shutters with storebought clips and a few sections of shingles leaving some of the blatch familys possessions wet but the structure and furnishings intact so blatch has power from a generator drinking water food and the help of his soninlaw 25yearold

health a few weeks ago sierra sandison was a contestant in the miss idaho pageant she wasnt a diabetes advocate or even a person who widely shared with her friends that she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 18 much has changed since then sierra was backstage at miss idaho during the first night of competition when she had a chance meeting with miss idahos outstanding preteen 12yearold mccall salinas sierra stepped out of her dressing room and heard these words oh my gosh is that an insulin pump sierra told me that her stomach flip flopped when she realized that mccall recognized her insulin pump for what it was i thought oh no people are going to notice i was hoping that it was little enough that no one would notice sierras second reaction to mccalls words i got scared but then mccall quickly explained that she also had type 1 diabetes and that she didnt use an insulin pump because she was scared of what her friends would think and of how it would look it was during this brief encounter that a diabetes advocate was born sierra sandison a 20yearold woman who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes only two years prior was about to make a decision that would change her life she could disconnect from her pump when she took the stage in her swim suit or leave it on and help mccall to not feel quite so alone at the time that their exchange took place sierra told me i had no idea that i would even make the top 10 let alone become miss idaho but i thought i have to do this for mccall during the interview i mentioned to sierra that i believe people become advocates when they realize that they care more for another person than they do for themselves this was that moment for sierra when she left that conversation with mccall she was a different person and that person didnt want mccall to be worried about what other people would think it only took sierra a second to decide that she was going to walk on stage wearing her insulin pump i have to do this for mccall she thought it was really scary to walk out on stage but thinking about mccall gave me a whole new confidence suddenly sierra didnt care what the audience or the judges thought and the prospect of becoming miss idaho or miss america became secondary when she came off stage mccall walked up to sierra and said now i want to get a pump sierra balled her eyes out when she realized that something she had done helped another person to find the confidence to be him or herself if this story stopped here it would be amazing and completely worth sharing its a story of two strangers who find each other by chance both unaware of how much they are in need of the others support a simple and beautiful story of humanity empathy and the power of sameness but social media had other plans for this moment and later when sierra shared a photo of herself and mccall on facebook along with a brief description of how they met backstage and the events that transpired immediately after sierra found a community of loving people living with diabetes that she didnt know existed and they had her back the outpouring of support that she received on facebook prompted sierra to share a different photo this time of her walking on stage in her black bikini with her insulin pump on her side this is the first time that she would use the hashtag showmeyourpump in an instant 20yearold sierra sandison went from being a hopeful pageant contestant who got caught up in the desire to support a little girl to the face of confidence and security for people everywhere who live with insulin dependent diabetes her image was about to inspire countless thousands to share pictures of themselves with their insulin pumps on social media sierras very unintended coming out party was suddenly and gleefully part of the ethos now everywhere you look on tumblr facebook twitter instagram google and the rest of social media people with diabetes are showing their pumps to the world in an effort to become invisible the chain of events is continuing on sierras decision to support mccall has become a phenomenon of strangers holding up their pumps in support of sierra and in support of themselves we are witnessing humanity at its best we are witnessing people whose desire to support a stranger is helping them to overcome the same insecurity that brought sierra and mccall together all any of us want is to be anonymous and in a world where different is often looked upon with fear the people who want need and deserve that anonymity sometimes have to stand front and center to get it show them your pump until no one sees it today because a little girl noticed an insulin pump on a strangers hip people who live with diabetes are a lot closer to that goal i told sierra that my hope is that one day soon another girl will walk onto a stage wearing an insulin pump and that no one will notice no one will post a picture ask for an interview or bat an eye thats the world i want to live in its the world mccall needs and the world that sierra sandisons bravery brought us all onestep closer to when she showed us her pump we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased

worldnews seoul reuters north korea responded on friday with measured tones to us president donald trumps decision to call off a historic summit with leader kim jong un scheduled for next month saying pyongyang hoped for a trump formula to resolve the standoff over its nuclear weapons program on thursday trump wrote a letter to kim to announce his withdrawal from what would have been the firstever meeting between a serving us president and a north korean leader in singapore on june 12 sadly based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your most recent statement i feel it would be inappropriate at this time to have this longplanned meeting trump wrote trumps announcement came after repeated threats by north korea to pull out of the summit over what it saw as confrontational remarks by us officials fridays response by north korean vice foreign minister kim kye gwan was more conciliatory specifically praising trumps efforts we have inwardly highly appreciated president trump for having made the bold decision which any other us presidents dared not and made efforts for such a crucial event as the summit kim said in a statement carried by state media we even inwardly hoped that what is called trump formula would help clear both sides of their worries and comply with the requirements of our side and would be a wise way of substantial effect for settling the issue he said without elaborating n korea has just published the englishlanguage version of its statement on trumps pullout from the singapore summit pictwittercomwjri8q0i3x north korea has sharply criticized suggestions by trumps national security adviser john bolton and vice president mike pence that it could share the fate of libya if it did not swiftly surrender its nuclear arsenal libyan leader muammar gaddafi was deposed and murdered by natobacked militants after halting his nascent nuclear program trump had initially sought to placate north korea saying that he was not pursuing the libya model in getting the north to abandon its nuclear weapons program white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders also said this is the president trump model hes going to run this the way he sees fit kim kye gwan said north koreas recent criticisms of certain us officials had been a reaction to unbridled american rhetoric and that the current antagonism showed the urgent necessity for the summit his sudden and unilateral announcement to cancel the summit is something unexpected to us and we can not but feel great regret for it kim kye gwan said while noting that north korea remained open to resolving issues with washington regardless of ways at any time north koreas measured response provided some solace for nervous financial markets with asian shares almost flat i suspect they couldnt agree on denuclearisation said masahiro ichikawa senior strategist at sumitomo mitsui asset management but looking at comments from both sides none of them is ruling out holding a meeting in the future so i do not expect to see an immediate escalation in military tension while the trump administration had insisted on north koreas complete verifiable and irreversible dismantling of its nuclear program pyongyang had always couched its language in terms of denuclearisation of the korean peninsula north korea on thursday announced it had completely dismantled its punggyeri nuclear test facility to ensure the transparency of discontinuance of nuclear test footage of the event broadcast by south korean media on friday showed explosions throwing huge clouds of dust and debris as they destroyed tunnel entrances as well as multiple wooden structures around the site other images showed north korean officials displaying a map of the site including several major tunnel complexes they said were unused and completely operational prior to being collapsed still some analysts are worried the canceling of the talks could prompt a resumption in hostilities on the korean peninsula including renewed shorterrange missile tests or steppedup cyber attacks by pyongyang and increased sanctions or deployment of new military assets by washington trump in scrapping the june 12 summit in singapore sounded a bellicose note warning kim of the united states greater nuclear might reminiscent of the presidents tweet last year asserting that he had a much bigger nuclear button than kim speaking later trump said the us military stood ready if kim were to take any foolish action and that the united states would continue its maximum pressure campaign of sanctions to press north korea to give up its nuclear weapons south korean president moon jaein who worked hard to help set up the summit and urged trump at a white house meeting on tuesday not to let a rare opportunity slip away said he was perplexed by the cancellation he urged trump and kim to talk directly us secretary of state mike pompeo and his south korean counterpart kang kyungwha held a phone call and agreed to continue working toward creating the right conditions for the united states and north korea to talk the souths foreign ministry said in a statement on friday china north koreas main ally and trading partner has publicly urged the united states and north korea to keep up the dialogue and work to reduce tensions however trump had suggested in recent days that kims more defiant tone followed a meeting with chinese president xi jinping the official china daily said trumps cheeky invitation for kim to call or write to set up a meeting meant the letter did not slam the door shut on talks in the future after 65 years some maneuvering is to be expected but all parties need to keep in contact and work toward the same goals the china daily said in an editorial
environment bundled up tight and clutching mugs of hot chocolate we wondered thoughtfully through the fragrant pine forest finally just as the snow started to pick up one of us would spot it the perfect tree it was always my brother or me who spotted the tree but somehow im sure my dad pointed us there or maybe we just spotted every tree until we got the nod when my dad crouched beneath this magical tree with his saw i never failed to feel a pang of guilt surely we shouldnt be cutting down a tree trees are important didnt we just plant a tree on arbor day as a child these pangs of guilt were short lived and immediately washed away by the warmth and glitter of decorating day as an adult though the environmental impact of my choices is important to me a 2011 study revealed a neckandneck or trunkandtrunk if you will race between real and artificial trees for environmental supremacy in the long run the habits of the individual consumer have weigh much more into the sustainability of either option than do the trees themselves rows upon rows of fresh trees wreaths garlands and other decorations are available every day at detroits eastern market at this time transportation is one of the most significant environmental impact factors in the holiday tree industry it seems obvious to say that an artificial tree shipped from china will have a greater impact than a us grown real tree but this isnt always the case mass shipping practices are much more efficient than personally owned vehicles cumulatively long family trips in search of a real tree may have a greater carbon footprint than mass shipping of artificial trees so the first consideration consumers should undertake is comparing the distance to the tree farm or farmers market versus the distance to wherever they might purchase an artificial tree this will also need to be coupled with how many times one plans to make such a trip every year for real trees less often presumably for artificial trees which brings us to both real and artificial trees contribute to our already overburdened landfills the methods consumers choose to dispose of their trees as well as how long they choose to keep and use their artificial trees also figure into calculations of which is the more sustainable option a consumer needs to reuse an artificial tree for 5 10 years in order to establish an environmental impact lower than that of real trees one study stated an artificial tree would need to be reused for 20 years to have this effect on the disposal side real trees seem to come out ahead artificial trees are generally nonbiodegradable and will languish in a landfill for centuries laced with petroleumbased chemicals when disposing of an artificial tree consider donating it to a charity a needy family or a resale store there may also be recycling possibilities available depending on where you live still the more than 50 million artificial trees in use in the us as of 2010 have to go somewhere at the end of their lives and they unlike real trees cannot become mulch just because real trees are biodegradable does not mean the landfill is an environmentally conscious disposal solution for them items in a landfill biodegrade very slowly and take up precious space with real christmas trees there are many treecycling options when i was a kid in western michigan we had a christmas tree graveyard in the woods behind our house where our holiday trees when to await their fate as firewood when i lived in new york city a good friend sought out real trees to be chunked up and given as toys to the orangutans at the bronx zoo at eastern market in detroit any unsold christmas trees as the end of the season are turned into mulch for the farmers there are several options out there the landfill should not be one of them the most common indictment levied against artificial christmas trees is the fact that they usually contain pvc and often lead that is enough of a concern for me i dont want my baby crawling around beneath a tree that might contain lead or pvc but what about pesticides christmas trees are farmed just like any other crop the plus side of this is that when you cut down a live holiday tree youre not contributing to deforestation youre simply harvesting a crop grown for that purpose the downside is that many tree farms use contemporary farming practices meaning pesticides and chemical fertilizers i dont really want my baby crawling around in that either my options are then to either declare this one a tossup and base my decision on the other factors and keep my baby well away from the tree which is about as easy as keeping my cat away from the tree or to seek out an organic tree farm or an artificial tree company that does not use those chemicals there are environmental and social benefits to tree farming according to earth911 a single farmed tree absorbs more than 1 ton of co2 throughout its lifetime with more than 350 million real christmas tress growing in us tree farms alone you can imagine the yearly amount of carbon sequestering associated with the trees additionally each acre of trees produces enough oxygen for the daily needs of 18 people further more than 100000 people in the us are employed by the live christmas tree industry images courtesy of detroits eastern market there are also jobs created in the us by the artificial tree industry there are a few a few us producers of artificial christmas trees these include christmas in america new jerseys holiday tree and trim co and uschristmastreecom a few years ago we hatched a plan to have an indoor tree for all holidays we purchased a contorted filbert for this purpose one spring sadly it succumbed to aphids just as it was sprouting leaves still a year round potted holiday tree is an idea im fond of and one we will probably try again in the future another popular alternative is to purchase a small potted tree and then transplant it outside in the spring you can purchase a potted pine tree at most nurseries that will survive the holidays in its pot and can then become a thriving part of your home landscaping the daily green also recommends decorating an outdoor tree instead of bringing a tree into your home this isnt the ideal alternative for me or my kids but for some people it might be just perfect i do remember when i was a kid we used to run all the extension cords in our house an my dad was a carpenter so we had plenty way out into the woods and string up a white pine with colorful lights then we would make balls of birdseed and peanut butter with paperclip hooks to decorate that tree our own special holiday offering to nature and i remember many winter evenings gazing out our frosted windows at the twinkling lights way out in the snowy woods in the real vs artificial debate real trees still come out ahead in my book where we live in detroit its pretty easy to make it a real michigan christmas if you live in an area where real trees are hard to come by or require a lot of travel the answer might be different for you either way please keep in mind that there are a lot more ways to green your holidays than simply choosing the right tree for you did you know that the lights you choose to put on your tree actually have a much bigger impact than the tree itself a switch to led lights is a major step toward sustainability this holiday season led lights use about 16 the amount of energy that traditional christmas lights use just make sure you recycle those old lights americans throw away 25 percent more trash during the thanksgiving to new years holiday period than any other time of year the extra waste amounts to 25 million tons of garbage or about 1 million extra tons per week if every family reused just two feet of holiday ribbon the 38000 miles of ribbon saved could tie a bow around the entire planet if every american family wrapped just 3 presents in reused materials it would save enough paper to cover 45000 football fields the 265 billion christmas cards sold each year in the us could fill a football field 10 stories high if we each sent one card less wed save 50000 cubic yards of paper this year consider sending digital holiday cards purchasing paper products made only from 100 postconsumer recycled materials and reusing other paper products to make cards and wrapping paper there are dozens of templates available for converting cereal boxes to gift boxes plastic bags to festive bows and more urban earthworm features a long list of alternative gift card and wrapping paper ideas including my favorite homemade seed paper what gifts you give this year and where they come from also have a huge impact if you can avoid giving stuff that is always a good idea i dont really need any more harry potter or dr who memorabilia really i dont but a sessions at the local areal yoga gym or someone to do the dishes for me especially that last one would be ideal the list of nonmaterial gifts is nearly unending and is only limited by your creativity shopping local is another key way to reduce your impact this holiday season for those in the detroit metro region the local and handmade gift possibilities are endless from the detroit merchantiles merry market to michigan artisans there are few excuses not to shop local this season thrift and resale shops are also a great alternative a builtin form of recycling ill never turn down a thriftshop pile of books and of course one doesnt want to overlook all the local offerings at eastern market we remain committed to

take the better you are treating the environment if you can walk to the stores or take public transit all the better if not consider trying to consolidate all your shopping into one trip happy and green holidays to you
economy another bout of selling gripped the us stock market friday as anxiety mounts over whether the frenzy behind a swift meteoric rise in gamestop and a handful of other stocks will damage wall street overall the sp 500 dropped 19 giving the benchmark index its biggest weekly loss since october the dow jones industrial average and nasdaq each fell 2 gamestop shot up nearly 70 clawing back much of its steep loss from the day before after robinhood said it will allow customers to start buying some of the stock again gamestop has been on a stupefying 1600 run over the last three weeks and has become the battleground where swarms of smaller investors see themselves making an epic stand against the 1 the assault is directed squarely at hedge funds and other wall street titans that had bet the struggling video game retailers stock would fall those firms are taking sharp losses and other investors say thats pushing them to sell other stocks they own to raise cash that in turn helps pull down parts of the market completely unrelated to the revolt underway by the cadre of smaller and novice investors the maniacal moves for gamestop and a few other formerly beatendown stocks has drowned out many of the other issues weighing on markets including the virus vaccine rollouts and potential aid for the economy our consideration is whether this is something that is a longterm

over president joe bidens proposed 19 trillion economic aid package hopes for such stimulus for the economy have carried the sp 500 and other major indexes back to record highs recently along with enthusiasm about covid19 vaccines and the federal reserves pledge to keep the accelerator floored on its help for the economy low interest rates from the fed can act like steroids for stocks and other investments we are still moving towards a recovery from the pandemic just a heck of a lot bumpier than anyone had expected said stephen innes of axi in a report wall streets focus remains squarely on gamestop and other moonshot stocks amc entertainment jumped 537 and headphone company koss vaulted 525 after their success with gamestop traders have been looking for other downtrodden stocks in the market where hedge funds and other wall street firms are betting on price drops by rallying together into these stocks they are triggering something called a short squeeze in that a stocks price can explode higher as investors who had bet on price declines scramble to get out of their trades the smaller investors meanwhile have been crowing about their empowerment and saying the financial elite are simply getting their comeuppance after years of pulling away from the rest of america weve had their boot on our necks for so expletive long that the sudden rush of blood to our brains when we have just a asteriskchanceasterisk of getting free has made me feel well its made me feel one user wrote on a reddit discussion about gamestop stock ive been isolated throughout this entire pandemic and live in a state far from home or any sense of community another user replied id kind of just given up these last few weeks ive started caring again feeling impassioned again wanting more again most of wall street and other market watchers say they expect the smallerpocketed investors who are pushing up gamestop to eventually get burned the struggling retailer is expected to still lose money in its next fiscal year and many analysts say its stock should be closer to 15 than 330 in response many users on reddit have said they can keep up the pressure longer than hedge funds can stay solvent although they often use more colorful language to say that this week robinhood and other online trading platforms restricted trading in gamestop and other stocks that have soared recently prompting outrage from individual investors on twitter and other social media sites after easing up on some of the restrictions early friday robinhood tightened them again throughout the day limiting the number of gamestop shares that customers could buy by 303 pm eastern time they could not purchase any more if they already had at least one share the sec said friday that it is evaluating the extreme price volatility of certain stocks trading prices warning that such volatility can expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence jacob frenkel a former sec enforcement attorney and federal prosecutor suggested it may have made sense for the market watchdog agency to suspend trading for up to 10 days in gamestop stock under its legal authority merely monitoring the situation without sec action is like putting safety experts in a permanent frontrow seat in front of a runaway roller coaster frenkel said an enforcement investigation by the agency would need to determine whether there were violations of the securities laws said frenkel who heads the government investigations practice at law firm dickinson wright both the senate banking committee and the house financial services committee plan to hold hearings on the gamestop controversy the capital markets need to be less of a casino and more of a place where people can invest in

health this article first appeared on quietrevcom forget fourletter words i can withstand most swears even inventive ones with the steely composure of a seasoned dock worker its a single fourword phrase that when uttered by a new acquaintance has been known to evoke a fierce visceral reaction of the negative variety dont get me wrong i love a solid hug from someone i know and trust if youre my mom dad auntie judy or friend cherie quality huggers every one youre coming in hot with open arms and im on board my moms hugs crescendo into a tight squeeze that takes my breath away for just a second her palms like shock paddles sending a warm wave through my ribs its nice when faced with a new person though i usually think a hug feelsinappropriate i havent agreed to this level of intimacy im not ready to clash collar bones and yet here we are historically i havent responded to surprise hugs well i am all too aware that in a room full of people sending a wouldbe hugger into a public retreat of rejection would be very awkward so i relent more than once ive leaned in rigidly for a shouldersonly hug the lower half of my body thrown behind me at such an angle that i may as well be balancing a champagne glass on it and trying to break the internet and for a long time my tendency to freeze came with a certain level of guilt i almost bought into the hype that to be introverted is to be cold it was only time and maturity and a bit read a lot of research about introversion that gracefully delivered me to the conclusion that im not an ice queen my exploratory process is what i like to call the falling down a rabbit hole method what it lacks in efficiency it more than makes up for in satisfying my enneagram type 5 investigator personality when it came to dissecting my own antihug platform i devoured things like this piece in the huffington post written by a woman who sounded a lot like meshe similarly realized over time that her sometimespreference to keep a safe distance from people was not a personality flaw i read a lot of blogs like this they were unscientific but entirely validating i also found that some cultures are simply less apt at fostering and rewarding introversion and privacy over extroversion the idea that common demonstrative greetings in the us are merely a cultural tradition wasnt new to me but being reminded of it in print was still reassuring i began to doubledown on the belief that im not dysfunctional i would just prefer to say hello with a wai i even dove into articles distilling the science behind introverted brains as i marinated my noggin in these newfound facts i felt a weight fall off my shoulders and i developed a new sense of self i realized that some combination of physiology and psychology has made me selective about social interactions and physical contactand thats okay once i became less selfconscious about my aversion to spontaneous hugs and started talking about it to people i knew a few things happened first i found out i wasnt alone some of the friendliest warmest most likely to be a hugger people i knew responded to my revelation that im not really a hugger with oh my god me neither its so invasive secondly i found out that even rabid huggers were much more receptive to backing off than i expected once i talked about preferring to reserve hugs for people in my inner circle they typically gave an understanding reply and let me initiate future hugs all of this is to say im relieved to have found that i was putting too much pressure on myself to conform to a social norm most people dont mind that i greet them with a smile and a handshake or a friendly wave instead of a hug but more importantly i now dont mind being more open and authentic in my own way in giving myself permission to hold back from hugging every person i meet ive noticed that i am usually warmer when i first greet or bid farewell to someone because i am not tensing up for an impending fullbody high five i feel more at ease and that changes the temperature of the entire interaction of course sometimes the energy of a new friend feels very welcoming and i break all these rules and happily advance toward their outreached arms but its important to give myself the goahead to stretch out my hand for a shake instead when a hug is not what i am feeling at the moment i dont think we introverts should beat ourselves up about perceiving personal space as sacred space it doesnt make us frosty on the contrary it makes us more thoughtful about and therefore genuine with our affection were not lovedepriving freaks which is what i will remind myself the next time a friend of a friend of a friend starts with sorry im a hugger

worldnews mazatlan mexico its just before 8 pm but in the sierra madre mountains south of el paso the darkness is almost complete save for a single light that illuminates a small house we have spent the last 12 hours driving through mexicos heroin heartland where thousands of tons of poppies are harvested and processed every year before being smuggled to the united states and the view from the modest house near the peak is spectacular the person i have come to meet rafael caro quintero aka the prince is unlikely to enjoy the view however caro quintero is a man on the run hunted by mexican and american authorities he never sleeps in the same spot twice according to his guards his bed is a sleeping bag his roof the canvas of a tent during the day he haunts the mountains like a ghost his head perpetually craned toward the sky scanning for the drones that search the impassable mountains for signs of life the us drug enforcement administration believes that he along with ismael el mayo zambada is the leader of the sinaloa drug cartel one of the largest most powerful criminal drug trafficking organizations in the world with tentacles that extend throughout the americas and into europe asia and africa they also believe he is a murderer who even if he spent almost three decades in prison still hasnt paid in full for his crimes the torture and death of an american undercover agent and a mexican pilot as a journalist ive spent the last 13 years hunting the leaders of the drug cartels whose bloody business has shaped life in mexico almost 250000 people have died in the drug wars over the last decade according to the countrys national institute for statistics and geography and those are just the confirmed victims at least another 34201 people have disappeared investigating drug trafficking in mexico ive made frequent trips to the golden triangle trying to understand how farmers children who often cant read or write manage to rise to lead criminal networks that generate billions of dollars in profits people such as joaqun guzmn el chapo ruben oseguera cervantes el mencho and caro quintero the prince now after months of trying through intermediaries to persuade caro quintero i have come to this house on this january evening to meet with the man at the top of the deas most wanted list wed spoken in 2016 but i want to get a better sense of the life of a man whom the us justice department is so eager to get they are offering a 5 million reward for his capture once inside the house i am led to a bedroom the light suddenly goes out the prince has arrived the trip started 12 hours before in mazatln sinaloa for decades this port city on mexicos pacific coast has been a key point for drug traffickers a destination for both business and pleasure for the members of the sinaloa cartel its also the site of some of the bloodiest battles for control of the organization two guys in their 40s pick me up in an old car at an agreedupon spot near the beach i see no sign of weapons the men are polite dressed modestly and without any thuggish swagger still as on all these trips the destination is unknown and the return uncertain they tell me to bring a hat and a jacket because of the cold the cold i wonder it is over 70 degrees already and its 8 am i am only allowed to take a small video camera a tripod and a light for the interview i am told to leave everything else behind handbag phone tape recorder even the people taking me dont know where we are going after five hours on the road we stop at a hotel they ask again if i am carrying a phone or any other electronic device we switch cars and by now i am glad i brought the extra clothes the temperature has dropped as we have driven into the mountains during the next four hours we switch cars three times before we get to a house where we stay for about an hour i have overheard the mexican military is operating in the area and the men are waiting for instructions on whether to keep moving or abort the plan as they discuss this a convoy of soldiers approach us in military trucks but they appear not to notice us and drive past the afternoon goes by we change vehicles again and take off on a dirt road through a ravine barreling across stones and holes before ascending the mountain range at this time of the year the fields look barren but come autumn the hillsides will be covered in marijuana plants and red poppies most people around here are involved in some part of the illegal drug trade whether growing harvesting or processing the drugs but with the land asleep we see few people around suddenly the driver hits the brakes and stops the engine my heart is pounding like a locomotive the men get out of the car and look up at the sky pointing they have seen a drone they say they are concerned that i may not be telling the truth that someone is following me to get to caro quintero we dont speak about it but im quite certain theyre thinking about el chapo who in 2015 met with sean penn and the mexican actress kate del castillo for an interview the mexican government intercepted communications between the drug lord and the actress and el chapos confidantes believe the interview led to his arrest a few months later today he is locked up in a maximum security prison in new york waiting for a trial that is expected to result in a life sentence after several tense minutes we get back in the car the guards constantly look toward the sky then back at me with suspicion the area is full of government drones they say and their boss barely sleeps sensitive to their buzzing he claims to hear constantly hell often wake his guards before daybreak because he thinks someone is coming to arrest him some nights theyve had to walk perilous routes in the dark along the cliffs because he believed the authorities were closing in more than once caro quintero has taken a fall in the darkness he refuses to have surgery for his diseased prostate for fear of laying up at a hospital for a week leaving him exposed to arrest for months he hasnt seen his wife diana espinoza who he met in 2010 when he was still in prison or their 5yearold son nor has he seen any of the four children he had with his first wife mara elizabeth elenes this is not the glamorous life he once led like el chapo caro quintero was born in badiraguato a small town in the state of sinaloa when caro quintero was 14 he saw a stranger murder his father in a random act of violence after that he began growing marijuana as a way to support his family by the early 1980s mexico had become a strategic crossing point for cocaine going to the united states caro quintero by then in his 30s rose to become one of the three leaders of the guadalajara cartel which eventually allied itself with the medelln cartel led by the notorious colombian trafficker pablo escobar legends and narcocorridos the ballads that celebrate the lives of the drug lords made him and the other crime bosses into largerthanlife characters depicting them as celebrities who led glamorous lives of luxury and excess but an enterprising undercover dea agent named enrique camarena had infiltrated the guadalajara cartel and was gathering information on the billiondollar criminal organization in 1984 hundreds of mexican soldiers raided rancho bfalo a marijuana plantation run by the guadalajara cartel acting on information obtained by camarena the estimated annual production at the ranch was worth hundreds of millions of dollars in retaliation the cartel allegedly kidnapped camarena and a mexican pilot named alfredo zavala the abduction triggered a diplomatic crisis between the us and mexico the reagan administration all but shut down the border in response when the mens bodies were found a month later bearing marks of torture the dea began a massive manhunt for the killers the guadalajara cartel and its leaders caro quintero miguel ngel felix gallardo and ernesto don neto fonseca were obvious suspects fonseca was arrested in 1985 and still lives under house arrest at his ranch gallardo was detained in 1989 and is still in prison in jalisco caro quintero for his part was arrested in april 1985 and extradited to mexico where he signed a confession to the murder of camarena caro quintero spent the next 28 years in prison before he was released in 2013 on technical grounds he was free for only a few days before the office of mexicos attorney general issued a new order of arrest for an outstanding charge in mexico and to face charges for camarenas murder in the united states the decision to release caro quintero had infuriated us authorities who put up a 5 million reward for information leading to his capture or conviction the light comes on the prince has arrived he greets me warmly and reaches for a silverplated gun tucked into the back of his waistline excuse me he says as he puts his gun on the table three guards take positions outside a fourth stays in the room slim and straight like a billiard cue caro quintero wears an adidas hat pulled down over hair dyed a deep black in smart blue pants and a green jacket he appears younger than his 65 years but his shoes are mudcovered and he is sweating suggesting that life in hiding is taking a toll all i do is run for something i already did my time for he says since his release in 2013 he has recanted his admission of guilt in the murder of camarena he admits to having trafficked marijuana in the past but he claims those days are behind him he is not the shadowy leader of the sinaloa cartel that authorities make him out to be he says but the narcomantas the banners that criminal gangs use for public declarations tell a different story narcomantas have appeared alleging that caro quintero and el chapo are the bosses in northern mexico and us and mexican officials likewise claim that caro quintero is in charge of trafficking shipments of cocaine meth and heroin to the united states whoever is saying so is lying he says its a lie he acknowledges that after he was freed he met with el chapo and ismael el mayo zambada garca before el chapo was arrested weve known each other for many years just like ive known zambada he said i have my respect for them and thats all i havent done any business with them and now that im free i dont want to have anything to do with drugs i ask him about the 2015 seizure of five tons of cocaine in puerto peasco sonora which the mexican government said he was shipping i have already made it very clear he says im not a drug trafficker ive never moved heroin ive never dealt with amphetamines ive never brought a single gram of cocaine from colombia as the dea says what i sold was marijuana in mexico 33 years ago whoever says otherwise i repeat is lying why i ask would the dea finger him as a drug lord the us and mexican authorities are driven by misplaced vengeance he says look he says im not the leader of any cartel heres the report in which they accuse you i respond yes yes yes he says looking over the papers seemingly irritated well i havent returned to drugs nor am i going to ever whoever is saying that is lying sajid or whoever is saying this to the dea is lying in october caro quinteros cousin sajid emilio quintero navidad aka the cadet was arrested by us authorities on jan 25 he pleaded guilty to charges of drug trafficking and money laundering according to a filing in a federal court in california which suggests he may have made a deal with prosecutors and capturing caro quintero is still a priority for the us government if its sajid whos accusing me sajid is lying and if theyre saying im one of the sinaloa cartel leaders theyre making that up too caro quintero says closing his hand into a fist in early march hundreds of soldiers were dispatched to the golden triangle in the hunt for caro quintero rio doce a local newspaper quoted an officer who said the militarys orders were to catch him dead or alive but what is the truth about caro quintero us and mexican officials say he is trafficking cocaine from colombia to the united states through guatemala and that it crosses through sonora on a route that ultimately leads to chicago the dea stands behind the information contained with our 2017 national drug threat assessment and we believe rafael caroquintero is a sinaloa cartel leader agency spokesman wade sparks said in a statement but mike vigil former head of the deas mexico operations says its ludicrous to claim that caro quintero has a leadership role with the sinaloa cartel hes a shell of himself vigil says of caro quintero right now we dont have any information that he is actually working with anybody i think he just wants to stay away from getting arrested again probably up in the mountains of sinaloa where he knows its harder to catch him caro quintero denies that hes involved with drug smuggling i would ask that the dea be more cautious in its investigations and the government of mexico too he says if they can prove that its really true ill turn myself in but im not turning myself in to become an informant the way he tells it he spent almost three decades in prison for a murder he didnt commit he says he smuggled marijuana but didnt peddle harder drugs and says that since his release five years ago he has not been involved with drug smuggling according to him justice has been amply served the legends and narcocorridos tell dazzling stories that romanticize the lives of the kingpins yet having encountered caro quintero in person i feel a bit like ive met the wizard of oz here behind the screen is someone whos spent much of his life projecting a fearsome vision of himself only to be revealed as a frail and ailing old man but is this just another form of subterfuge a way to disguise a leader in the regional drug trade look what i want is for people to leave me in peace he says what i have left of life i want to live it in peace all of us i believe deserve a second chance as i get in the car that will take me back to mazatln i see the prince standing by the house in the darkness he soon disappears from sight

science a universal flu vaccine one that provides immunity against every strain of the influenza virus for multiple years is the holy grail of flu research it would be a medical breakthrough on the order of penicillin with the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives every year and scientists just got one crucial step closer to making it a reality two separate groups of scientists published papers this week demonstrating that a new type of flu vaccine can provide protection against multiple strains of the disease rather than just one though a truly universal flu vaccine that could be given to humans remains years away infectious disease experts hailed the new findings as a major breakthrough these are very good papers there are no problems with them dr peter palese a renowned flu expert at mount sinai hospital in new york told the huffington post what we need to do now is put these vaccines in humans and see if they work thats the only question at this point one group of researchers whose findings were published in the journal nature medicine tested the new type of vaccine on mice and ferrets while the other group which published its paper in science tested it on monkeys both teams found that the vaccine increased the test subjects immunity against both the h1n1 flu type often called swine flu and the h5n1 type or bird flu until now all flu vaccines have only been able to protect against one specific strain of flu even if its determined that the new vaccine type can work in humans years of clinical trials will be needed before such vaccines could come to market but if the research pans out experts believe that within the decade we could have a vaccine that protects against all strains of influenza for years on end the goal would be to try to make it so that you dont have to get immunized every year but maybe once every five or 10 years that would be a major step forward american virologists jonas salk 19141995 and thomas francis 19001969 developed the firstever flu vaccines in 1938 every vaccine developed since then has operated on the same basic principle the vaccines lead the human immune system to produce antibodies that attach to the end of the flu viruss hemagglutinin the part that the virus uses to access our cells the antibodies prevent the virus from successfully invading the cells and causing disease but the reason vaccines can protect against only a single strain of the flu is that the ends of the hemagglutinin are structured differently in each strain flu shots generally contain three or four different types of vaccines so they can offer immunity to the handful of strains that scientists predict will be most common in a given season but the flu virus can change its genetic makeup so quickly that the ends of its hemagglutinin change completely from year to year which is why a vaccine given one year confers little to no immunity from a subsequent years flu strains hence the need to get a flu shot every fall but the scientists who wrote the two papers published this week took an entirely different approach instead of targeting the invasive ends of the hemagglutinin they targeted the stems which connect the ends to the rest of the virus since the structure of these stems doesnt vary much between different strains of the flu an antibody that attacks the stem should defuse a wide variety of strains scientists never even thought to develop vaccines aiming at the hemagglutinin stems until recently because it only became clear a few years ago that humans produced antibodies that targeted the stems thats partially because humans dont produce very many of these antibodies and its still unclear whether any vaccine could spur our immune systems to produce enough stemtargeted antibodies to fight off flu strains even if a vaccine can trigger production of a sufficient quantity of stemtargeted antibodies no one knows how long the body will do so after vaccination so we have no idea how long any immunity conferred by such flu shots would last in a perfect world it would last for life said dr ian wilson of the scripps research institute in la jolla california who is one of the authors of the science paper but we have no idea how long it will last for the moment the goal would be to try to make it so that you dont have to get immunized every year but maybe once every five or 10 years that would be a major step forward still one concern is that flu viruses could start to vary the structures of their stems more widely than they currently do mitigating the advantage of this new type of vaccine its a constant arms race with all of these viruses wilson said basically the immune system can neutralize the virus thats infected with then the virus escapes and the immune system attacks the new virus this is a constant process with all viruses we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support

of the nature medicine paper told huffpost that the two teams were aware of one anothers work the researchers who published the science paper he said made the vaccine in a different way and used different materials and such but they ended up showing very similar results so both papers complemented each other and supported each other this is a proof of concept that puts us on a path toward a universal vaccine graham continued its not that we have something thats going to be in a bottle next year i dont want people to get that impression but it is exciting because it does put us on this path that could lead to something
social four minutes late to his first class of the day an 11thgrade boy at oaklands skyline high school swung into his seat and blurted an explanation i had a bad nosebleed last night his us history teacher jimmy barbuto looked up being late to class can wreck the morning flow at school provoking confrontations and derailing lesson plans im sorry to hear that barbuto replied the remark was a nod to their shared humanity as well as an academic strategy a tiny moment of modeling social skills that is part of a blooming movement in education known as social and emotional learning while the term is jargon the concept is straightforward help students recognize and manage their emotions so they can get excited about academics and get along with others the class rolled on anyone doing selfmanagement barbuto asked his 28 students who sat in rows and paid a good deal of attention considering they were teenagers in the early morning having appropriate things on the desk oakland unified is one of hundreds of school districts in california that have adopted social skillbuilding in an effort to move from zerotolerance discipline and drillandkill curriculum toward a more nuanced approach to the behavioral and academic needs of students oakland unified has boiled down the concept to three signature teacher practices most of them familiar to accomplished teachers a warm welcome at the start of the day perhaps with a morning circle depending on the age of the students engaging teaching such as encouraging students to pipe up with their opinions while learning how to listen to the opinions of others closing out the school day on an optimistic note by asking students to take a moment to consider what theyve learned or someone theyve helped today there has been an explosion of interest in this work emily doolittle a researcher at the federal national center for education research said at a panel discussion late last month of leaders in the field who contributed to a new issue of the journal the future of children dedicated to social and emotional learning and with that explosion has come heightened concern among proponents about how to spare social and emotional learning from the fate of many ideas in education the fizzle in education it seems like theres a fad a month said ron haskins codirector of the center on children and families at the brookings institution which copublishes the future of learning with princeton university what are the crucial steps that need to take place to make sure social and emotional learning continues to advance that is the question being asked by educators nationally and in california where the california department of education in 2016 joined a multistate collaborative to develop guidelines for social and emotional learning no consensus has emerged on what skills to teach or how to measure results but interest in social and emotional learning is driven by evidence of its effectiveness said roger weissberg chief knowledge officer at the collaborative on academic social and emotional learning a chicagobased nonprofit we have a commitment to rigorous science weissberg said but the evidencegathering is still in progress we dont have all the answers in the field he said i worry about the fizzle a great deal said stephanie jones an associate professor at the harvard graduate school of education as with any initiative overselling is a risk spreading the belief that social and emotional learning will fix every educational ill jones said she referenced a maxim from her graduate school mentor watch out for the quick fix clark mckown a psychologist and associate professor at chicagos rush university medical center proposed that the field move to set standards for social and emotional learning and provide incentives for school districts to adopt welltested programs in addition he called for teacher training programs to require courses in social and emotional learning all of this rests on the development of an accurate way to assess whether social and emotional learning programs are helping students with academics and behavior he said those efforts are in the works at the state and national level weissberg said in the meantime mark greenberg a professor of human development and psychology at pennsylvania state university laid out the current state of the field in a description sure to resonate with administrators struggling to get their arms around what social and emotional learning is and why schools should care about it the concept typically is introduced in schools as a fragmented succession of fads or quick fixes isolated from everyday educational practices greenberg and his coauthors wrote in the future of children the result he said is a hodgepodge of prevention treatment and youthdevelopment initiatives with little direction coordination sustainability or impact part of the mishmash is generated by a profusion of programs that use different approaches including videos discussions and roleplaying to develop different and sometimes overlapping skills in wallys feeling wheel in the incredible years series program kindergartners learn about their feelings and those of others using pictures of faces grimacing smiling or frowning that are labeled as scared excited angry and more in the promoting alternative thinking strategies program elementary school teachers promote empathy by leading a discussion about how a story character might feel such as a girl whose family tells her they are moving to the us and she will be given a new name and for high school students many programs have not yet shown results said david yeager an assistant professor of developmental psychology at the university of texas at austin yeager explained that teenagers need programs that dont preach to them or imply there is something wrong with them instead approaches that tap into a teenagers desire to make a difference in the world can wake up a students interest he said he also cited the success of a teacher mentoring program called my teaching partnersecondary that helps high school teachers create an intellectually challenging but respectful classroom students who felt their intelligence was respected did a better job of following classroom rules yeager said in oakland the district has invested in social and emotional learning in elementary schools for years and is rolling out the concept in a few high schools including skyline through teacher training the idea is to integrate social skill building into academic instruction in us history class barbuto turned to the question on the overhead projector screen who was responsible for the battle of little big horn as the discussion progressed barbuto jotted highlights on the screen he noted that native american tribes spoke dozens of languages and then he segued into a tip that at once promoted learning selfawareness and planning for me because im a visual learner taking notes is important barbuto casually remarked if i took notes it meant i had to do way less studying in the future and it was easier to write the essay pens moved in notebooks

science honeybee loading pollen into her corbicula or pollen basket from lemon blossom in hollywood calif honeybees are incomparable little creatures allow me to tell you why honeybees and humans share many things in common we socialize dance eat honey touch feel mimic one another sleep enjoy nicotine caffeine vote and we both get sick after a queen honeybee lays a couple million eggs she begins to produce fewer pheromones or chemical scents which cause the worker bees to feed half a dozen larvae royal jelly or pure protein as they begin rearing a new queen its up to the scout bees to locate a new site to move the existing queen and thousands of workers to create with their beeswax a new hive the bees reach a consensus on a new location by voting research has shown that 15 is the crucial number of scout bees for a quorum then they wait for the signal to evacuate are you like me and millions of other people who find our morning caffeine buzz irresistible well were not alone our friends the honeybees also seek a morning buzz from flowers containing nectar laced with caffeine that caffeine boosts the bees memories causing the buzzed forager bees returning to the hive to dance vigorously and communicate to other bees the precise location of the caffeinated flowers it seems that some plants have evolved an ingenious mechanism of using caffeine as a drug to get the upper hand on the bees to pollinate their flowers first not only do bees pollinate 75 percent of all the worlds food crops but also all the cotton we wear honeybees produce an astounding 26 billion pounds of honey each year for humans one teaspoon of honey weighing 21 grams contains 16 grams of sugar or 60 calories it takes 12 honeybees a combined flying distance of about 6000 miles or their entire foraging lives to produce those 21 grams of honey normally a forager honeybees dies because after flying 500 miles in three weeks and visiting almost a million flowers she wears her wings out or to put it another way she works herself to death these admirable little creatures can count to four and they can be trained to arrive at three four and five separate periods during 24 hours for the previous 15 years my colleagues have been training honeybees to identify over 60 different odors ranging from enriched uranium to tuberculosis methamphetamine or crystal meth and tnt the main explosive in landmines honeybees are now being deployed instead of sniffer dogs to locate more than 250000 landmines at sites left behind in the 1990s war in former yugoslavia by the way sniffer dogs cost 9000 each are accurate approximately 71 percent of the time require three months of intensive training and they get maimed honeybees on the other hand are accurate 98 percent of the time require less than 10 minutes of training and they preclude sniffer dogs from being harmed or killed by finding those unexploded landmines our friends the humble honeybees will help prevent the maiming of hundreds of children playing in croatia and bosniaherzegovina just like people and dogs bees get sad when they are handled or manipulated too much or if they dont get enough sleep when predators repeatedly attack them bees learn while asleep and they may dream too bees show similar signs of pessimism seen in depressed or anxious people honeybees and people even share genetic similarities some thrill seeking honeybees just like people are drawn to adventure and there are over 1000 genetic differences that affect a bees likelihood of being a thrill seeker we remain committed to providing you

health it is becoming more and more prevalent these days with those who are spirituallyminded to create a sacred space within their home they use a corner of a room and place candles stones or simply some of their favorite things there and sit in silent meditation many people carry that idea over into their workplace and display pictures of loved ones and objects that are meaningful to them on a small area of their desk in order to feel grounded when their job becomes stressful however i have to wonder if sacred space is really confined to a particular place that each of us has to go to in order to feel centered and peaceful instead of us going to it why cant it come to us maybe sacred space can actually follow us around wouldnt that be nice always feeling centered no matter where we are it all comes down to having an awareness of being surrounded by love and peace at all times having a close connection to ones soul not just ones physicality take a look at the following techniques and see if you can create your own sacred space wherever you are envision yourself inside a beautiful bubble of light this bubble can be iridescent or white or any color that you love practice being in the sanctity of this cocoon sit in it walk around do whatever you want to do but remain in your imaginary pod everything around you is happening as usual however nothing can come inside the sacred space of your bubble no one elses drama no stress because inside you know that nothing can touch you its energy transcends whatever you are doing all is peace and love as you go about your day think of yourself as a human magnet the only situations and individuals that are attracted to you and vice versa are good positive and uplifting everything else simply falls away the things that make you happy that you want around you are made of metal these wonderful people places and things are drawn to you and stick like glue all of the other stuff is just plastic observe life as if you are watching a movie which people form the main cast of characters who are in the supporting roles stand back and look around is everyone acting their usual part are the same little episodes playing out just as they have a thousand times before be an audience member does any of what is going on really involve you or can you detach from the scene do you need to be a part of the action or is observing from an emotional distance a viable alternative make a cameo appearance when its your cue otherwise just keep watching yes this is in fact a movie but im not suggesting that you start watching it every day no what im getting at here is the power of music to calm the mind and soothe the body investing in a pair of ear buds or ear plugs can be exactly what you need to create your portable sacred space tuning in to relaxing music or even total silence and tuning out the rest of the world for a short while may be just what your psyche ordered so when feasible make quiet time for yourself anywhere you can let go of all the unnecessary noise around you getting some real peace and quiet even for a brief moment in the day is extremely helpful in centering the self we all walk from here to there during the course of a busy day make that time count as sacred time be mindful of your bodys movement feel your arms and legs cutting through the thickness of the air ideally find a way to walk outside as much as possible even if its through the middle of a bustling city they say the fresh air does wonders for a person and theyre right when away from city life being surrounded by trees water rocks birds and grass is healing in every way let nature speak to you listen to it become a part of it be open to its ancient teachings of growth death and rebirth the cycle of life walking on a treelined trail can feel like an outdoor cathedral filling one with reverence and awe for the beauty of gods creation your cares and concerns will seem quite small and you will find peace whether you are driving back and forth from the office soccer practice or appointments taking the train into town for the day or flying for business or pleasure there is useful quiet time there that should not be overlooked traveling time that is spent alone can be me time use those moments in the day to focus on your breathing your positive thoughts and your intentions dont think about work or what you have to do next be present in those minutes or hours that time should be spent getting to know yourself nurturing your connection with spirit and thinking of all the wonderful things for which you have to

social when my children were much younger i loved playing wheres waldo with them trying to find the character in the distinctive hat amidst a confusing mass of other figures they have grown and now i play wheres esea this week marks what probably will be a threeweek hiatus for seeing the elementary and secondary education acts esea redandwhite striped hat why three weeks because both houses of the congress are in session this week and then go home for two weeks while the congress is in session the only likely action on esea reauthorization will be behind the scenes in the senate this means continuing negotiations between the staffs of senate health education labor and pensions help chair lamar alexander rtn and ranking member patty murray dwa in their oneparagraph press release two weeks ago the two announced they were looking to an april 13 date for markup meaning bring a bill to the full help committee to amend approve and send to the full senate floor at least the senate is engaging in negotiations between the two parties in the house any behindthescenes activity involves negotiations within only one party eseas hat was briefly seen on the full house floor a few weeks ago and then vanished amidst republican conflicts titled the student success act the houses bill to reauthorize esea had passed from the house education and the workforce committee on a strictly partyline vote no negotiations preceded its introduction or committee markup to pass on the house floor required an almost unanimous republican vote since few if any democrats felt any involvement in the legislation while the majority party is often able to roll over the minority party this was not to be for this esea version which fell victim to the connected twin ts of timing and tea party bad timing because the bill was on the floor on the same day as the tumultuous us department of homeland security funding measure and it is never a good day for a house speaker when he must throw over a large part of his party and go seek the votes for passage from the other party strike one against the house bill a bunch of republican members seething at their own leadership then strike two came as letters from the club of growth and heritage foundation challenged the conservative credentials of the bill to many esea followers a bill eliminating several categorical grant programs greatly restricting the traditional federal role in education pushed through with no democratic participation and already earning a veto threat from the white house seemed to have ample conservative chops but combine republican internecine conflict with objections from two pillars of the tea party conservatives and the speaker pulled the bill from the floor so waldos hat now is squashed somewhere in the speakers desk drawer whetherand whenit appears is unknown since a house speaker is nominated and elected by their party membership he or she cannot make too many end runs around their party base and unlike the homeland security flap where the speaker was able to pick up democratic votes to offset the opposing republican ones no similar option exists for this bill so dont look for too many esea hat sightings for several weeks the senate staffs continue negotiating quietly the house republicanstrying to convince each other that the bill has conservative credentialsmay be negotiating with themselves and where might the first significant sighting occur look closely for the distinctive red and white striping beginning the week of april 13provided the senate negotiations actually result in full committee action

social as the school year ends for all levels of education i want to put forward one final quiz especially for our high school and college students to answer if you do not know the answer to a question just move quickly to the next one 1 name the last three recipients of the noble prize in literature 2 name the last three persons to be the general secretary of the united nations 3 name the three wealthiest individuals in the world 4 name the last three winners of the academy award for best actor 5 name the last three heisman trophy winners 1 name three of your favorite teachers in high school or college 2 name three neighbors who live in your neighborhood 3 name three local stores you have done business with in the last month 4 name three people you telephoned emailed texted or wrote a letter to in the last month 5 name three people you spent time with during the past monthjust hanging out with chances are you had some trouble with the first five questions and were able to answer the last five rather easily this is the time of year we have high school and college commencement ceremonies in final words of advice to the graduates the commencement speakers generally talk about working hard and becoming successful about becoming famous wealthy and generally important you know things that the first five questions relate to but are these really the most important things of life the things we should be reminding our graduates to concentrate on as they make their way in life in my opinion subjects relating to the last five questions are the really important things in life that commencement speakers should be encouraging graduates to concentrate on these are about the relationships we establish in our daily lives these are about how we look after and treat one another in our daily lives these are about the character of the people we choose to do business with these are about morality caring nurturing loving and on the list goes sure worldly success is important we need to have jobs and have money to support ourselves our families and our communities but if the majority of citizens have the qualities associated with the last five questions we will automatically have communities where there are churches synagogues mosques and temples that help people develop the qualities of life that will assure we have good schools the qualities that find ways to provide meaningful employment and living wages for people who are able and willing to work and ways to provide for those who cannot care for themselves qualities that will see to it that there will be moral and legal justice for people of all ethnic backgrounds qualities that develop safe neighborhoods generally free of petty crime and brutality qualities that assure that kindness happiness respect and concern for others good times and love will reign over selfishness greed bigotry discrimination hatred and brutality these are in my opinion what we should be talking about as we send our graduates into the world to begin contributing in their own unique and godgiven ways to daily life i have heard it said that there is a difference in young love and mature love young love seeks to be happy mature loves seeks to make others happy we cannot expect our young graduates to have developed a maturelove attitude they are quite naturally intent upon their own happiness but if we instill in our graduates the true attributes of love we can expect them in time to develop into mature people who automatically practice a combination of young love and mature love in their daily relationships and isnt that what we all should be experiencing in our lives happiness for ourselves as we also bring happiness to the lives of others when all of us are practicing the combination of young and mature love the task of seeking happiness for ourselves will be so much less necessary as others will also be involved in helping us to be happy an old saying comes to mind what goes around comes around i have not been asked for many years to be a commencement speaker but it i were asked i have just provided you with an outline of what i would say some of the ideas for this blog were gleaned last weekend as i listened to the reverend father stephen a privett sj phd president of the university of san francisco during his final commencement ceremony as president of usf he is retiring this year after fourteen years as the universitys president

sports the major league baseball players association plans to join the aflcio labor federation putting one of professional sports top unions in a formal alliance with other labor groups tony clark the former switchhitting first baseman who is now the unions director announced the new affiliation at the national press club in downtown washington on wednesday he was joined by liz shuler president of the aflcio which includes 57 other unions representing more than 12 million workers clark said the pandemicshortened 2020 season and the lockout that preceded the current season prompted the union to think about its own place in the labor movement the truth is we reflected on where our organization was and the things we could potentially do moving forward as part of the broader labor discussion clark said the aflcio functions as a powerful lobby for organized labor in washington looking out for the interests of its member unions legislatively and acts as a bridge between unions operating in different industries the federation was formed in 1955 in a marriage between the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations the mlbpa represents around 1200 baseball players many of whom make a lot of money by joining the aflcio the union will be affiliated with many workingclass unions including unite here which represents thousands of concessions workers at baseball stadiums around the country the aflcio also includes the nfl players association and the national womens soccer league players association the national basketball players association is not a member the baseball players union joins the federation at a time when its trying to organize more workers the mlbpa announced tuesday that it had gathered union authorization cards from more than half of minor league players that would be more than enough cards to trigger a union election under the national labor relations board but the union has asked major league baseball to voluntarily recognize the minor league union clark said the mlbpa hoped to strengthen our player fraternity by organizing minor leaguers and improving their working conditions noting that many struggle to scrape by on extremely low wages the minor league players are the backbone of our industry clark said its important that they have a voice at the table the potential bargaining unit in the minor leagues would include more than 5000 players a large organizing effort for the mlbpa there may be ways the aflcio could assist in that effort and help amplify the unions message shuler called the minor league campaign an inspiration people often think that being a professional athlete means youre just set up for life she said i think there are a lot of misperceptions out there about that minor league players are dealing with poverty wages and a chronic lack of respect unions typically pay percapita taxes to be members of the aflcio meaning workers indirectly fund their unions membership clark did not get into the specifics of the mlbpas arrangement with the aflcio but said players recognized that now was the time to join whether youre working on the pitch or on a baseball field or on a construction site were all concerned about safe workplaces george atallah a spokesperson for the nfl players union said it was important for all of the sports unions to be aligned with one another as well as the other unions on the periphery of their industries being part of the aflcio can help accomplish that he said when we were locked out in 2011 the first people who came to our aid were the steelworkers the hotel workers the communications workers they were all there for us atallah said solidarity is not just one union within itself but from one union to another the major league baseball owners locked out the players ahead of the 2022 season for three months before both sides reached a new 5year collective bargaining agreement matthew loeb president of the international alliance of theatrical stage employees said wednesday that the work stoppage showed how much common interest players have with other workers noting that many of his unions members in broadcasting werent able to

again shuler said there was no question that major league ballplayers have a large platform and that their star power could help the aflcio and its member unions in their battles with employers but she said that wasnt the significance of the mlbpa joining the point here is were all workers and we all have the same struggles shuler said whether youre working on the pitch or on a baseball field or on a construction site were all concerned about safe workplaces
social i might not be the right person to write this blog post i am white i grew up in a town that is nearly 100percent white i can honestly say i have never spent any time worried that my husband brothers or nephews would be treated unfairly by the american justice or education systems i know now that if i were not white this would be unlikely to be true my daughter sophia looking at a boardedup window along south grand ave in saint louis where windows were broken following the announcement that ferguson police officer darren wilson would not be indicted in the killing of 18yearold michael brown it was not until 2005 when i started teaching in st louis public schools that i even began to understand the privileges that the way i look has conferred on me in the wake of the shooting death of 18yearold michael brown by ferguson police officer darren wilson one instance in particular sticks out now it was a day about halfway through my first year teaching when a parent asked me if i would help her plan how to introduce her 10yearold son to the police in the wealthy suburban town where he was going to be attending school after he left my classroom the mother knew her son would be staying at his new school late to visit friends play sports etc and did not want him to draw unnecessary police attention simply because he was black as i listened to her talk through the benefits and downsides of taking him to the police station to introduce him versus giving the police station a picture of him i felt the weight of my white privilege in the wake of events in ferguson much of the conversation around privilege and the policing of africanamerican communities has been about the psychological weight this adds to africanamerican lives what that conversation in my classroom nine years ago taught me was that i should be feeling a weight too the weight of my privilege i see the inherent unfairness of privilege as a weight that can only be lifted when i work to be better to do better to be an ally to call out privilege to change systems it is with that in mind that i ask this question how do we fulfill our responsibility to this generation of children so that they can realize sooner than i did that our systems are broken and that it is everyones responsibility to fix them the surest way i know how is by doing the following 1 stop allowing zip codes and finances to determine a childs future one of the criticisms that the ferguson police department has received over the last three months is that there are only three africanamerican officers on its police force if anyone in the st louis region was surprised by this he or she must not have been paying attention forcing african americans to attend failed schools has kept jobs in the regions police departments out of reach for far too many african americans there is no single solution and school choice is never going to solve all our nations equity problems i know that but imagine if for the last 30 years children in normandy where michael brown was a student or in other north st louis county schools had been able to choose where they went to school imagine if they had had access to the same highquality schools that their more privileged peers had imagine if they had not been banished to schools where their chances of dropping out were higher than their chances of learning to read if this had been the case perhaps the ferguson police department would look a lot different than it does we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves

continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again 2 make civics history and government a priority and hold schools accountable for teaching those subjects much like school choice betterinformed and engaged citizens will not solve all our nations equity problems but it sure can go a long way toward creating citizens who can i for one grew tired of hearing about how voting was going to change the future of citizens in north st louis county so i do not mean simply educate students about the importance of voting what i do mean is that we need to create a system that teaches students that the government is theirs to hold accountable and follow that up with teaching how to be an advocate for yourself and others i do mean make sure all students know that they are equal under the law i do mean make sure all our students understand that the saying if you want peace work for justice is not just a bumper sticker but is what makes a democracy work this will not just show our children of color that their lives matter but will guarantee that all our students know the importance of valuing all our differences and valuing all lives this is essential for creating a system where none of our students grows up to be a governor who is afraid to talk about race or who puts his own political future above the needs of a grieving community it will help prevent our students from growing up to be the police officer who pulls the trigger when a conversation would have sufficed it will ensure these things because teaching our students about their civic responsibility and the history of our democracy the real history not a whitewashed one will demonstrate what st louis pastor traci blackmon said is true your liberty is connected to mine our country has a long way to go we have a lot of wounds to heal and a lot of work to do no one person holds the key to healing the wounds fixing the system and fulfilling the dream but it is time we all accept the responsibility to listen and act as a nation when even one person says i cant breathe
science near the beginning the universe was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep thats because until about a billion years after the big bang there were no galaxies or stars to illuminate the heavens which were then filled primarily with neutral hydrogen gas but a rare ultrahighenergy stellar explosion called a gamma ray burst grb has offered a new glimpse into this obscure periodthe socalled cosmic dark agesand may help nail down precisely when it ended a study of the explosions afterglow suggests that such neutral hydrogen abounded a billion years after the big bang so the dark ages werent quite over then a team of japanese astronomers reports the dark ages lasted until the first stars and galaxies formed from gathering clumps of gas and their light broke apart or reionized the hydrogen atoms today the vast majority of hydrogen in intergalactic space is ionized to find out when that happened researchers want to measure how much neutral hydrogen was still around at various times in the universes past one way to do this is to detect the socalled 21centimeter radiation a faint radio signal emitted by neutral hydrogen but the radio telescopes able to do this are not yet accurate enough to see that far back into the past astronomers can also look at the light from quasars which are very bright galactic nuclei to search for the absorption of telltale wavelengths of light by nearby neutral hydrogen surrounding the quasar ionized hydrogen does not absorb optical radiation but quasar spectra can be harder to interpret because quasars reside in large galaxies and will likely have ionized much of the gas around them anyway a third way is to study grbs very rare but exceedingly powerful explosions that occur when a large rapidly rotating star collapses and causes a supernova or hypernova the explosion shoots a narrow beam of radiation into space which if it is pointed toward earth appears as a flash of gamma rays in the sky that lasts seconds or minutes followed by a longer lasting afterglow at longer wavelengths as with a quasar radiation from a grb afterglow can be used to search for neutral hydrogen in the explosions neighborhood grbs are potentially cleaner as sources of light because they originate in small galaxies or away from galaxies altogether tomonori totani an astronomer at the university of tokyo and colleagues got a lucky glimpse of just such a grb grb 130606a was detected last june by nasas swift satellite as is common for such an event these days telescopes the world over swiveled to catch some of its light including japans subaru telescope in hawaii because it was very bright subarus faint object camera and spectrograph was able to measure the spectrum of its afterglow precisely what made this grb special was that it was very distant with a redshift of 5913 which means that it exploded when the everexpanding universe was just oneseventh its current size and only 1 billion years old from the grbs spectrum the researchers calculate that 10 of the intergalactic gas surrounding the burst consisted of neutral hydrogen they report in a paper to be published in june in the publications of the astronomical society of japan the abundance of neutral hydrogen suggests that the reionization process that ended the dark ages was not yet complete at that time its an interesting result and the best constraint on the epoch of reionization coming from a grb writes astrophysicist avery meiksin of the university of edinburgh in the united kingdom in an email but better data has come from a quasar discovered in 2010 its redshift of 71 puts it just 770 million years after the big bang extensive analysis of its spectrum showed nearby gas to be at least 10 neutral hydrogen and similar analysis would be needed to draw firm conclusions from this grb meiksin says id say the main significance of this result is that its a grb which promises that there will be more data similar to it in the future he adds rennan barkana an astrophysicist at tel aviv university in israel agrees that the very highquality spectrum provides mild evidence of neutral hydrogen but there are many uncertainties he says that evidence from grbs is very promising the main limitation of this kind of study is the low event rate of such bright grbs at sufficiently high redshift totani writes in an email but that situation will likely improve in the next decade as the next generation of gigantic telescopes such as the thirty meter telescope and the european extremely large telescope come online totani says as they should be able to spot much fainter and hence more abundant grbs httpnewssciencemagorgphysics201405distantstellarexplosionhelpsmapuniversesdarkages this story has been provided by aaas the nonprofit sciencesociety and its international journal science
worldnews as a nation what weve seen over the past few weeks is complete havoc wreaked by natural disasters from hurricane harvey destroying homes in texas to hurricane maria uprooting every structure that puerto ricans need to survive personally ive seen the heartbreaking reality of my best friend experiencing extreme anxiety while being unable to contact his family in puerto rico for several days but after seeing all this chaos id argue that the most devastating part is actually what we havent seen and that is any semblance of leadership from the white house as the president and ceo of a public health center network the physical wellness of my fellow human beings is my first priority because on the most basic level our bodies are the vessels in which we all live one short life making them all deserving of care and respect similarly the federal governments first and most basic job is to protect the physical safety of the people yet our socalled leaders are currently neglecting 34 million us citizens in puerto rico whose bodies are in grave danger right now only 17 of puerto ricos 69 hospitals have power and 15 million of the islands inhabitants are deprived of clean drinking water more people have died from the lack of medical services following hurricane maria than from the storm itself and hundreds more are at risk of unnecessary death yet our president has spent his time joking about the islands debt insulting its leaders and undermining the number of people that the island has already lost forever unfortunately this is an all too familiar story during hurricane katrina the failure of the us government to evacuate africanamerican residents and the slow disaster response that followed illustrated the racism that permeates us relief efforts our governments lackluster response to puerto ricos crisis taken in tandem with trumps disrespectful dialogue lay bare this racist reality yet again time after time our government makes it clear that they only care about protecting certain bodies that should infuriate each and every one of us we are caught in a moment when we must all ask ourselves what role we will play in helping our neighbors in puerto rico when the man sitting in our nations highest office is too incompetent to do so himself what st johns is doing is sending doctors armed with hundreds of pounds of medicine to puerto rico next week we hope that people across the country continue their generosity so that we can collectively free puerto rico from the unimaginable burden of the storms effects while the aftermath of hurricane maria is devastating enough puerto ricos tragedy extends beyond disaster relief puerto rico a colony that has been long neglected by the us government and abused by wall street deserves the same treatment that were able to provide our community here in south los angeles thanks to our status as a federally qualified health center weve been able to serve our homeless and undocumented brothers and sisters at low to no cost to them and as the largest provider of health care services in the largest area of contiguous poverty in the continental united states we know that health care is a catalyst for social racial and economic justice in order to ensure that puerto rico can create sustainable structures that will weather any storm the federal government must extend the same privileges and support to puerto rico that they provide to mainland usa for now its time that this countrys elected officials start recognizing that health care is a fundamental human right for all no matter where you live in the meantime its up to all of us to step up and provide our neighbors in puerto rico with the help that they need

science by stephanie pappas livescience senior writer published 03232012 0107 pm edt on livescience with a statement decrying the obama administrations blind eye toward enforcement of federal obscenity laws republican presidential candidate rick santorum has brought the subject of pornography into the presidential campaign but some of santorums statements about the ills of explicit material may not hold up in a statement first posted last week on his campaign website santorum cites a wealth of research demonstrating that pornography causes profound brain changes and widespread negative effects in both adults and children including violence against women theres no such evidence of brain changes researchers say though the question of pornographys harmfulness is still in some dispute its very easy if you want to support one side or the other to pull a particular study said paul wright an assistant professor of telecommunications at indiana university bloomington who has studied sex in the media anybody can support one side or another by simply isolating a particular study and talking about it most experimental studies on the effects of pornography have focused on college students given their easy proximity to the psychology lab looked at individually these studies seem mixed some find that exposing young men to porn increases sexist attitudes and even a willingness to inflict pain often tested by having the men inflict what they believe are real electric shocks on a woman the shocks are fake other studies find little to no effect sex quix myths taboos bizarre facts to pull this disparate research together psychologists depend on metaanalyses or studies that analyze data from multiple single studies using this technique wright said the effects of pornography are fairly clear in experimental settings where actual aggressive behavior is measured as the outcome measure among males both violent pornography and nonviolent pornography increased the probability of subsequent aggression wright told livescience not all researchers put stock in experimental findings however the question became do these little tests that were having these guys do in the lab do they really apply to real life said chris ferguson a psychologist at texas am university who studies the link between media and violent behavior in real life of course researchers cant carry out controlled experiments on pornography one alternative strategy has been to look at sexual violence rates in countries right after pornography is decriminalized these studies many done by milton diamond the director of the pacific center for sex and society at the university of hawaii at manoa usually find that rates of sexual violence go down after pornography becomes more prevalent diamond sees this as evidence that pornography actually provides a catharsis for men who have sexually aggressive tendencies a brief history of porn the majority of the pornography dissipates the arousal by masturbation and i think that works both for males and females diamond told livescience and usually after somebody masturbates and they have their orgasm theyre not as interested in sex as they were 10 minutes before so i think it dissipates the interest to go out and do anything illegal theres no proof of this catharsis effect in the countrywide studies its not even possible to firmly link the drop in violence to pornography at all given the large number of other factors that could play a role the decriminalization of pornography could go handinhand with other societal changes that influence sexual violence ferguson said women might even be influenced by a more pornsaturated society to accept violence against themselves and not report sexual aggression wright pointed out or some other nonpornrelated factor might play a role nonetheless some researchers see the countrywide correlations as telling when you have people that are making these kinds of claims that its a major contributor to mens aggression toward women it makes sense to look at if that societal data point exists ferguson said internet pornography statistics if the laboratory studies are correct that pornography does increase male violence its a small to moderate effect said wright who is quick to point out that he does not advocate censorship in any case researcher neil malamuth of the university of california los angeles has found that exposure to pornography doesnt affect the average man but for men with other risk factors that predispose them toward sexual violence it can add fuel to the fire malamuth said it can make a person who perhaps has a certain proclivity a certain inclination a certain risk profile even more likely to act out in a sexually aggressive way malamuth said risky characteristics include hostility toward women a narcissistic personality and a tendency to derive gratification from power and control over women as well as background characteristics such as growing up in a violent home perhaps different studies are capturing different proportions of men with these characteristics which would explain the conflicting results malamuth said the focus on the link between pornography and aggression glosses over other potential pitfalls of porn including working conditions for the porn actors and the pressure on women to look or act like a porn star but some researchers are taking a closer look at the potentially positive sign of sexually explicit media in surveys pornography users generally see porn as a boon said malamuth pornography may have many beneficial effects for some people in their sexual lives and many dont see themselves as harmed in any way malamuth said in one study published this month in the international journal of intercultural relations university of hawaii at manoa researchers compared poses of women in photographs taken from popular pornography websites magazines and pornstar portfolios in norway the united states and japan these three countries were chosen because they fall in different portions of the united nations gender empowerment measure a measure of womens political and economic power in a nation norway is no1 globally on the scale the us is no 15 and japan is no 54 the researchers compared empowering and disempowering poses in the popular pictorial pornography of each nation an example of a disempowering photograph would be a woman tied up or contorted with little care given to her own comfort an empowering photograph would be the opposite for example an unbound woman facing the camera with confidence the researchers found that disempowering photographs were equally common across all three countries but norway had the highest number of empowering photographs followed by the us the findings suggest that pornography may mirror the gender equality or lack thereof of society at large according to study researcher dana arakawa a doctoral student at the university of hawaii at manoa its a reflection of what our culture produces to show what is sexy about women or what should be considered a sexual ideal arakawa told livescience the fact that relatively equal norway exhibits more examples of empowering images of sexual women is heartening arakawa said most americans have a vision of porn stars as stereotypically pouting playboy bunnies but that view of sexuality is limited in scope she said there is variety arakawa said pornography isnt just what we know of in the us you can follow livescience senior writer stephanie pappas

technology our world has become more social we are more than ever an interconnected species existing in new digitally urbanized neighborhoods that transcend physical geography our communities consist now not of our neighbors most of us dont even know who they are nor are our most frequent contacts with church or family our social interactions have become global and more often than not anonymous this is disheartening and dangerous ever since the unprecedented urbanization and suburban flight of the last half of the 20th century removed peoples workplaces and venues of worship from their immediate surroundings they have lost regular contact with the community and communion itself has become increasingly depersonalized this started with the facebook phenomenon whose main function was to reconnect an individual with old friends in order to share pictures and comments as the movie the social network pointed out to take the college experience and put it online perhaps im alone in this but i have found these rekindled connections to be wearisome the truth is most of us have very little to say to the onceimportant inhabitants of our past without the glue of shared experiences these old relationships are found to have been transient and without that same glue new electronic friendships are unable to truly develop we share so much with so many that instead of building intimacy it creates a vast electronic stage upon which we are all actors in some endless narcissistic play about ourselves this reality has caused a morphing of the role of social media it has now become causeoriented after the initial excitement of reconnecting with elementary school friends fades most users of social media find themselves friending people who share a similar cause or passion twitter is perhaps the maximum expression of this where those with whom one interacts are most often anonymous and where the interactions of 140 characters are thematic and usually trivial republicans deliver youtube videos democrats ask for money nameless faceless people hurl insults at each other across the digital divide activists rally others to their cause and ones popularity is determined by likes follows and views the entire process is utilitarian the problem with this is that causerelationships are shallow and onedimensional they are focused around a narrow issue and do not allow for the complexity of the human spirit to be expressed they do not facilitate the sharing of the fullness of mankinds experience and they rarely even change minds really modifying somebodys thinking is done through a long process which involves opening your life to them through the very human act of contact they are also fleeting much more ephemeral than even the seasonal relationships of youth unfriending or unfollowing somebody is done with the push of a button and not reconsidered never mourning the loss of a relationship that had never really even existed we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again finally these new relationships require no sacrifice true lasting friendships often come from mutual sacrifice the willingness to take the good with the bad and to even assumes certain responsibility for a friends wellbeing sometimes this is emotional sometimes financial and sometimes simply a listening ear virtual friendships do not allow for this once you are no longer useful to the cause you are discarded for those who do not believe this attempt to ask a friend on facebook or twitter to bend an ear to lend money to grieve with you the loss of a loved one or to wait with you in a hospital overnight you might find the only people who respond are those with whom you share a real physical relationship this is our new social world where we connect with thousands of people and nobody at the same time i cant help but think that we and those who come after are missing out on an important part of being human
entertainment here in the saveur test kitchen weve had ample opportunity to test drive a covetable selection of kitchen tools some of our favorites are the kitchen knives when it comes to style comfort and function many high end brands are worth every precious penny whether made in japan europe or the wisconsin the craftsmanship of the worlds top bladesmiths is worthy of admiration these are the workhorses of the kitchen so they should be your most thoughtful investment stick with something versatile nothing too long or too short durable hard enough to hold an edge but easy to sharpen and comfortable this is personal consider your own grip hand size and strength there are advantages to both european and asian style blades but for home use and for the widest range of applications consider a hybrid shape these two allpurpose chefs knives combine elements of both eastern and western styling perfect for trimming precise strips of sushi fish matchstick julienne vegetables or feathery chiffonade the new crowdfunded kitchenware company misen meezuhn as in mise en place is upending the way you stock your arsenal by connecting the manufacturer directly to consumer while giving other highend brands a run for their money their affordable chefs knife will only put you out 60 it combines japanese steel the taper and rock of classic western blades and an acutely angled edge for a sturdy yet nimble blade that can chop slice or butcher through your most ambitious kitchen projects japanese knife brand shun recently launched this superpremium line through william sonoma and im a little bit in love the attractive damascus patterning on the blade is sandwiched over alternating microlayers of highcarbon stainless steel the overlay provides a bit of texture preventing foods from sticking during cutting while the layers purportedly wear at different rates creating micro serrations that extend performance between sharpenings compared to true santoku blades the hikaris edge has a slight curve allowing for a bit of rock this speeds up tasks like milling through finely chopped herbs or mincing garlic and ginger the curved birch pakkawood handle is smooth and comfortable for a wide range of hand sizes theres little practical reason to break the bank on a luxury paring knife the arent heavy enough to warrant topshelf steel since they weigh next to nothing they arent prone to breakage when dropped the nimble tasks they are used for arent the sorts to necessitate much heft and sharpening a 3inch blade takes very little time and effort that said if you want to treat yourself to a fancy blade without dropping a chunk of change paring knives have the most attainable entry point i like to keep one or two reliable cheapo options on hand that can withstand a run through the dishwasher while stashing my snazzy custom mini away for more delicate tasks butchering small birds like cornish hens and squab separating fragrant strips citrus zest away from the bitter pith and coring juicy strawberries and tomatoes budget thai knifemaker kiwi brand is a staff favorite their blades are lightweight they come in a range of asian styles and shapes and they hold a precise edge better than many premium brands best of all they top out at 1695 many of kiwis knives including this petit chopper are only available with unfinished wooden handles that will degrade with time though at 495 you wont mind replacing this one in a few years im partial to the blade shape most paring knives are intended for working in the air with a choke grip and so theyre awkward for use on a cutting board this little guy has an offset heel like a fullsized chefs knife so your knuckles wont hit the board while chopping or slicing the butt of the handle has a gentle curve for a comfortable grip we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for

politics the senate failed to cap skyhigh prices for insulin on sunday as part of the democrats climate and health legislation a majority voted for it 57 senators but it wasnt enough under the senates 60vote rule for passage yet just a few hours later the senate successfully protected subsidiaries of private equity companies from a new 15 corporate minimum tax rate included in the legislation it received the same number of votes as the insulin cap amendment but this time the senate rules required only a simple majority to pass it the difference in fate between the two votes both of which received support from samesized majorities shows how the senates arcane and frequently arbitrary rules often add to an already malapportioned legislative bodys bias toward powerful interests people with diabetes looking for help to afford lifesaving medication need a supermajority while a simple majority is just fine for private equity managers looking to protect their fruitful investments most democrats up to a somewhat reluctant president joe biden have been prepared to scrap or severely weaken the filibuster rule the extraconstitutional provision requiring 60 votes to end debate in the senate that has come to function as a supermajority requirement for almost all legislation but sens joe manchin dwva and kyrsten sinema dariz have blocked any attempted reforms the combined effect of senate rules is to create additional chokepoints for interest groups to exploit its not a coincidence that every major piece of economic legislation passed through the senate during bidens administration had the backing of the us chamber of commerce which represents americas largest and most powerful businesses until sundays passage of the socalled inflation reduction act the bill raises taxes on investors and large corporations and spends the cash reducing the deficit and investing in clean energy and health care subsidies while also giving medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs the house is expected to pass the legislation and send it to biden later this week passing the bill on a partyline vote in the 5050 senate meant democrats were relying on whats called budget reconciliation but reconciliation requires every provision of the bill to have a direct and substantial effect on the federal budget making it useless for many social policies and any economic ones without a direct effect on federal taxation or spending the provision to cap insulin prices would have limited copays for insulin at 35 a month for people on private health insurance plans but the senates parliamentarian an unelected official accountable only to members of the upper chamber ruled it fell outside of whats allowed under reconciliation that meant the gop could challenge it and democrats would need to round up 10 republicans to keep it in the bill seven republicans all representing states with large swatches of rural poverty joined democrats susan collins of maine lisa murkowski and dan sullivan of alaska john kennedy and bill cassidy of louisiana josh hawley of missouri and cindy hydesmith of mississippi but it wasnt enough insulin prices have spiked in recent years and americans pay as much as 10 times more than what the drug costs in other economically developed countries fourfifths of diabetics who take insulin say the cost of the drug causes them financial hardship this wont just save money it will save lives sen patty murray dwash said on the floor before the vote this should not be a hard vote to cast the legislation still limits insulin copays to 35 a month for people who use medicare and democrats have promised a standalone vote on legislation sponsored by republican susan collins and democrat jeanne shaheen nh to keep costs low but unless three additional republicans are willing to back the legislation it will fail under the senates 60vote threshold two of the worlds largest drug companies eli lilly and novo nordisk have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of rising insulin costs since the beginning of democratic control of congress in 2021 the two companies have spent massive sums lobbying against cost controls eli lilly has spent 114 million according to federal lobbying records while novo nordisk has spent 58 million the private equity amendment on the other hand was backed by a powerful industry with a powerful ally in sinema who had already forced democrats to strip out an effort to tighten a loophole abused by the industry the arizona freshman feared the minimum tax would hit small and mediumsized businesses with private equity backing with a spokesman saying her goal was to target tax avoidance make the tax code more efficient and support arizonas economic growth and competitiveness other democrats said sinemas concerns were nonsensical unless the businesses had more than 1 billion in revenue they would be untouched i dont know very many small businesses at home that have a profit of a billion dollars a year sen ron wyden dore who chairs the senate finance committee told reporters on saturday night this is a very small number of businesses still with sinemas support and the amendments passage assured six other democrats facing potentially tough reelection battles in coming years mark kelly of arizona raphael warnock and jon ossoff of georgia jacky rosen and catherine cortez masto of nevada and maggie hassan of new hampshire voted for it hoping to avoid the industrys wrath in the future though sundays dueling votes provided a clear example the powerful have long abused senate rules when senators were still chosen by state legislatures in the 1800s wealthy men often bribed local officials to gain entrance to the chamber a practice that culminated in montana in 1899 when two mining magnates each spent 1 million on bribes hoping to win a senate election in the first half of the 20th century southern senators filibustered every single attempt at civil rights legislation in more recent years decisions by democrats and republicans to eliminate the filibuster for judicial and executive branch nominations has meant senate republican leader mitch mcconnell could enact much of his agenda passing tax cuts and appointing judges with a simple majority while more complicated democratic goals on issues from gun control to health care to voting rights still require 60vote pledges as recently as december 2021 the senate listened to cries of panic from business leaders and passed a onetime exception to the filibuster to raise the debt limit with fewer than 60 votes the senate is already far from a paragon of democracy it grants states with small populations wildly disproportionate power over american politics giving the typical rural american 37 more power than the average voter when it comes to determining control of the senate small states are also far less racially diverse than bigger ones meaning the typical black voter has 17 less influence over who controls the senate than an average voter and a typical hispanic voter has 33 less influence the filibuster exacerbates the bias toward smaller states the six senators who represent california new york and texas represent the same number of people as the 62 senators who represent the unions 31 smallest states more than enough to sustain a filibuster we remain committed to

governments hands when it comes to combating state and local governments who abuse their powers while gopcontrolled states passed a wave of voting rights restrictions this year democratic plans to

health this isnt actually going to be a post about health per se as i have a ton of those type of postings to come later this is however going to be posting about you and how releasing the neediness and clingytype behavior to the things in your life that are clearly no longer serving you and allowing the world to walk with you on your journey and see youmay be the best thing you could ever do for yourself six days ago my amazing surgeons removed my spleen to resolve my itp idiopathic thrombocytopenic pupura a lowplatelet and bleeding disorder that has wreaked havoc on my life for a little over a year since my surgery a week ago my platelet count has tripled tripled to a number i spent an entire year on steroids trying to achieve to get me out of the danger zone of having a spontaneous bleed at any moment and even scarier were the side effects brought on by giving my body such highpotency drugs for such an extended period of time and the rapid decline in my quality of life when i was first presented with the option of a splenectomy i have to say that resistance doesnt even begin to describe what i felt at the thought of losing such a vital organ then there was the fear no matter how much my hematologist and primary care doctor assured me that not only would my life mostly go on as usual without sasha yepi later named my spleen but because shes actually no longer serving her original purpose and causing harm i would experience a high success percentage from the disorder as well as regain that quality of life that i complained about at each and every doctor appointment and although this has been one of the toughest detours of my life ive learned quite a few lessons why was i resisting the removal of sasha when i was told time and time again that her removal could offer me a much better situation than what i was currently dealing with why did i somehow feel that if they removed this vital organ i would struggle to carry on as the me that i know that i am i struggled with the idea of losing this organ that had been with me my entire life even though it was clear she was betraying me its times like this that youre also shown who your friends really are not the people that you knowor the people you just accept friend requests from on facebook but the ones who pretty much think of you daily and because they truly know you theyre very aware of the battle youre fighting not only are they aware but they offer to fight alongside you if possible ive learned that no matter how much i encourage uplift or inspire others ive got to start with encouraging uplifting and inspiring myself firstprobably one of the toughest jobs the mindset work reminding me thatas i had told so many others before my diagnosisthat it was only a detournot a defeat but one of the most important things ive learned is that sharingallowing others to witness that i am a living breathing walking testimony of what holding on and pressing on looks like is the biggest way to have positive impact ive struggled in the past with allowing others to see my vulnerability and imperfections yet these turn out to be the very things god uses to propel you forward to uplevel you to help you take another step too many of us use our imperfections or even our pasts as a crutch an excuse a blemish on our canvas that prevents us from forging ahead it takes us way to long to understand that those are the very things that connect you to others that make you capable of loving being loved and relating to others where some cannot being human raw and transparent releasing the useless need to guard your footstepsand just walk in who you are and always have been to be proud of your battle scars and give the gift to others of believing in themselves that by watching you overcome they now know that they can too they can believe that the dark place they may be in is only a temporary facade a disguise but a necessary experience that if they just keep walking they will find the light at the end of the tunnel you will find your light and im here to tell you to just take one more step no matter how big just keep going little by little baby steps add up to miles your story may be different from mine but if youre still standing we have a lot in common

economy in the months since president joe biden warned russias vladimir putin that he needed to crack down on ransomware gangs in his country there hasnt been a massive attack like the one last may that resulted in gasoline shortages but thats small comfort to ken trzaska trzaska is president of lewis clark community college a small illinois school that canceled classes for days after a ransomware attack last month that knocked critical computer systems offline that first day trzaska said i think all of us were probably up 20plus hours just moving through the process trying to get our arms around what happened even if the united states isnt currently enduring largescale frontpage ransomware attacks on par with ones earlier this year that targeted the global meat supply or kept millions of americans from filling their gas tanks the problem hasnt disappeared in fact the attack on trzaskas college was part of a barrage of lowerprofile episodes that have upended the businesses governments schools and hospitals that were hit the colleges ordeal reflects the challenges the biden administration faces in stamping out the threat and its uneven progress in doing so since ransomware became an urgent national security problem last spring us officials have recaptured some ransom payments cracked down on abuses of cryptocurrency and made some arrests spy agencies have launched attacks against ransomware groups and the us has pushed federal state and local governments as well as private industries to boost protections yet six months after bidens admonitions to putin its hard to tell whether hackers have eased up because of us pressure smallerscale attacks continue with ransomware criminals continuing to operate from russia with seeming impunity administration officials have given conflicting assessments about whether russias behavior has changed since last summer further complicating matters ransomware is no longer at the top of the usrussia agenda with washington focused on dissuading putin from invading ukraine the white house said it was determined to fight all ransomware through its various tools but that the governments response depends on the severity of the attack there are some that are law enforcement matters and others that are high impact disruptive ransomware activity posing a direct national security threat that require other measures the statement said ransomware attacks in which hackers lock up victims data and demand exorbitant sums to return it surfaced as a national security emergency for the administration after a may attack on colonial pipeline which supplies nearly half the fuel consumed on the east coast the attack prompted the company to halt operations causing gas shortages for days though it resumed service after paying more than 4 million in ransom soon after came an attack on meat processor jbs which paid an 11 million ransom biden met with putin in june in geneva where he suggested critical infrastructure sectors should be off limits for ransomware and said the us should know in six months to a year whether we have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order he reiterated the message in july days after a major attack on a software company kaseya that affected hundreds of businesses and said he expected russia to take action on cybercriminals when the us provides enough information to do so since then there have been some notable attacks from groups believed to be based in russia including against sinclair broadcast group and the national rifle association but none of the same consequence or impact of those from last spring or summer one reason may be increased us government scrutiny or fear of it the biden administration in september sanctioned a russiabased virtual currency exchange that officials say helped ransomware gangs launder funds last month the justice department unsealed charges against a suspected ukrainian ransomware operator who was arrested in poland and has recovered millions of dollars in ransom payments gen paul nakasone the head of us cyber command told the new york times his agency has begun offensive operations against ransomware groups the white house says that wholeofgovernment effort will continue i think the ransomware folks the ones conducting them are stepping back like hey if we do that thats going to get the united states government coming after us offensively kevin powers security strategy adviser for cyber risk firm cybersaint said of attacks against critical infrastructure us officials meanwhile have shared a small number of names of suspected ransomware operators with russian officials who have said they have started investigating according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly its unclear what russia will do with those names though kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov insisted the countries have been having a useful dialogue and said a working mechanism has been established and is actually functioning its also hard to measure the impact of individual arrests on the overall threat even as the suspected ransomware hacker awaits extradition to the us following his arrest in poland another who was indicted by federal prosecutors was later reported by a british tabloid to be living comfortably in russia and driving luxury cars some are skeptical about attributing any dropoff in highprofile attacks to us efforts it could have just been a fluke said dmitri alperovitch former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm crowdstrike he said asking russia to crack down on largescale attacks wont work because its way too granular of a request to calibrate criminal activity they dont even fully control top american officials have given conflicting answers about ransomware trends since bidens discussions with putin some fbi and justice department officials say theyve seen no change in russian behavior national cyber director chris inglis said theres been a discernible decrease in attacks but that it was too soon to say why its hard to quantify the number of attacks given the lack of baseline information and uneven reporting from victims though the absence of disruptive incidents is an important marker for a white house trying to focus its attention on the most significant national security risks and catastrophic breaches victims of ransomware attacks in the past few months have included hospitals small businesses colleges like howard university which briefly took many of its systems offline after discovering a september attack and virginias legislature the attack at lewis clark in godfrey illinois was discovered two days before thanksgiving when the schools it director detected suspicious activity and proactively took systems offline said trzaska the president a ransom note from hackers demanded a payment though trzaska declined to reveal the sum or identify the culprits though many attacks come from hackers in russia or eastern europe some originate elsewhere with vital education systems affected including email and the schools online learning platform administrators canceled classes for days after the thanksgiving break and communicated updates to students via social media and through a public alert system the college which had backups on the majority of its servers resumed operations this month the ordeal was daunting enough to inspire trzaska and another college president who he says endured a similar experience to plan a cybersecurity panel the stock quote from everyone trzaska said is not if its going to happen but when its going to happen we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for

social the ib has concerns for humanity hardwired into it in its philosophical heritage its mission and todays curricula siva kumari siva kumari the first female director general of the international baccalaureate organization ibo has a lot on her mind as global education systems scramble to find better ways to teach international perspectives and intercultural competence to the first generation of world citizens kumari appears to be in the right place at an historic time many schools ask themselves these days how they can develop not just sound disciplinary competency but also character qualities such as courage integrity curiosity leadership resilience and empathy the ib schools have a long track record with this comments andreas schleicher director for education and skills and special advisor on education policy to the oecd secretary general it was in the 1960s that the ibs innovative curriculum began to take shape john goormaghtigh a holocaust survivor and founding president of the ibo council of foundation wanted to help create a world where understanding and peace would prevail talented educators were drawn to the ib such as alec peterson obe the first director general in 1968 who proposed what is today known as the creativity action and service component of the ibs diploma programme and the ibs theory of knowledge gerard renaud director general in 1977 continued development and implementation of the theory of knowledge or tok as it is called which enables students to see the important connections between different disciplines siva kumari joined the ib in april 2009 as its regional director for asiapacific a year later she was named its first chief operating officer and last year its seventh director general in the global search for education interview that follows she discusses the ibs philosophical heritage its work today with students and her vision for its future role in the world we work with our teachers students and schools all around the world we practice both deep local pride in an individuals culture and a connection to global issues siva kumari the uns 2030 agenda for sustainable development offers very ambitious and necessary goals how can the ib education encompass the un goals of prosperity equality and environmental consciousness and integrate them into the classroom we believe there is a link between what you teach kids and how they influence the world through understanding real world issues our mission is to develop such human beings who make the world a better place through education education is essential to equality to enable a level playing field ib students are encouraged to train their minds and to use knowledge and empathy to solve local and global problems in new ways not to merely learn the best way to top exams the ibs continuum of programmes offer a holistic curriculumat the core of the diploma programme dp for example are theory of knowledge and creativity activity service these are mindexpanding activities unique in secondary education which link ideas to actions and consequences and individuals and societies is one of the subject groupsin both the diploma and the middle years programmesin which students explore the specific issues you refer to ecological consciousness equality and the barriers to worldwide prosperity so the ib has concerns for humanity hardwired into it in its philosophical heritage its mission and todays curricula as the first woman to lead the ib how do you see the present state of gender equality in education what achievements have we seen what is left to be done although much has been achieved in recent years gender inequality still haunts our world we believe our educational programmes can help to close the gender gap for example we do extensive analysis to evaluate whether our exams bias children of one gender over another but what is left to be done is still vast education is about teaching students to think to stretch and to develop themselves on the basis of rational thought selfdiscipline research and inquiryand not least the deep instincts for justice and equality which are natural to 99 of the worlds citizens siva kumari the ib has already made significant inroads into global understanding and citizenship can the ib build on this foundation to bring internationally diverse peoples closer together and help foster peaceful relations among nations of course we can we must our children are growing up globally conscious more than ever and world events as we know today can have both immediate and trickle effects in other parts of this highly interconnected world the ibs founders however recognized the impact of internationalmindedness from the beginning and because we started with schools around the world 50 years ago our organization has developed deep fluency in the practice of these concepts in schools around the world nearly every day the ib brings educators together internationally since we work with our teachers students and schools all around the world we practice both deep local pride in an individuals culture and a connection to global issues this allows our students to be deep thinkers who are ambidextrous in their thinking they can think about their context and how those issues may or may not be connected to global issues the important learning aspect for me is that the ib schools and their teachers are able to deploy the ib in ways that make sense locally while upholding international standards this gives the ib student a different kind of highvalue currency than most of their peers our students are great ambassadors for mindful leadership since they are taught to address complex problems both through the curricula and through internationally competitive assessments they are prepared to soft land into the world we believe the ibs responsibility is to advocate educations role in developing young minds to address serious issues and we believe that our students use that preparation to address global issues carefully as great leaders in whatever setting they choose we teach students to analyze and adapt their patterns of thought and how they act on them it is about living life consciously and reflectively this requires habits to be honed throughout their school years siva kumari from your experience with students and teachers what are the most crucial needs for education leading up to 2030 how can the ib fill those needs i could talk about soft skills the digital revolution the environment and the challenge of teaching children to live lives and work in jobs which dont yet existbut id like to build on a broader context in its essence education is about teaching students to think to stretch and to develop themselves on the basis of rational thought selfdiscipline research and inquiryand not least the deep instincts for justice and equality which are natural to 99 of the worlds citizens the ib is not about teaching students to regurgitate memorized facts or to implement predefined systems of learning we teach students to analyze and adapt their patterns of thought and how they act on them it is about living life consciously and reflectively this requires habits to be honed throughout their school years i believe an education should equip students to thrive and prosper in the world no matter the focus of their interest or their chosen area of achievement it is to help create better lives to inspire them to give of their best and to make the most of their livesin whichever way is best for them the power of each individual to make change should not be ignored by educators or by the ib and excellence in education is about bringing the most rigorous standards and research to bear on creating curricula which open and free students minds by giving brilliant teachers and schools the support to operate at the very top of their game letting all their passion and commitment flow to inspire their students the ib is not into constant change in educational philosophies that leave teachers baffled this approach has served us well for nighon 50 years and it will serve us equally well for the 50 years to come these unwavering ideas will drive the ib to meet the educational challenges of 2030 and beyond and to help make the world a better place all pictures are courtesy of the

entertainment everybody has their own version of cheers a place they go to feel like a human again after a particularly trying day for me its wegmans and instead of drowning my sorrows in beer i do it with moderatelypriced sushi if youre not familiar with the store let me get you up to speed its a northeastbased grocery chain that wins people over by being a clean friendly place for anyone to shop regardless of budget the fact that this is remarkable says a lot about the way we shop today people really really love wegmans so much that theyll drive across state borders to visit one and petition the company to open a location in their town what attracts such unwavering loyalty here are just a few reasons 1 the company treats its employees well wegmans offers employees education scholarships and other benefits not normally associated with supermarkets there are also training programs that often send employees on trips across the united states and around the world in order to gain expertise in their product category a butcher for example could be sent on a trip to montana to visit the ranch of a beef supplier other perks have included health screenings and fitness benefits such as a 5k trainer you can enjoy a nice cup of coffee at the instore cafe or take a seat in the generouslysized cafe area also the overall store design is less like a starklylit warehouse or maze designed to entice you to buy chips and junk food instead upon arrival youre greeted with the produce department and gentle lighting this is a deliberate design decision based on the idea of an open air market 3 wegmans is one of the largest sellers of glutenfree products theyve been doing the whole gluten free thing since the 90s manufacturing private label products and ensuring clear labels i mean if youre going to fill your cart with exotic fruit and fancy cheese then yes your order will be pricey but the prices are well within the normal person range thanks to the focus on wegmans private label line of goods 6 they have really high product standards their seafood section is a great example of this youll find only fish that meets rigorous quality and sustainability standards their fishmongers are also prepared to educate you to an impressive degree about sourcing and ideal preparation in the produce department buyers especially look out for local suppliers 7 the checkout signs are grammatically correct 7 items or fewer 8 the prepared foods section is amazing i hate to say that its remarkable that a prepared food section should have nothing but fresh food and be cleaned regularly and old food taken away after its been sitting a while yet it feels like somewhat of a rarity not only can you find anything from sushi to squash salads but the entire section is pristine want to read more from huffpost taste follow us on twitter facebook pinterest and tumblr

social michael bodekaer 30 and mads bonde 29 founded labster an internationally focused company dedicated to the development of pioneering online tools for teaching science globally i conducted this interview for truth atlas driving innovation series which celebrates successful entrepreneurs it was originally published on june 9 2014 on truthatlascom you founded labster together what challenge are you trying to solve and what is your biggest goal as a change maker michael our vision at labster is to empower the nextgeneration of scientists to save the world whenever we talk with students and science teachers we always hear about two things on one hand schools tell us how they are challenged by the high costs of science education on other hand students are often bored in science classes because they are stuck with old text books and the schools simply cannot afford to carry out real practical lab experiments by creating labsters virtual laboratories weve been able to solve these challenges labster reduces schools costs by up to 90 percent and creates fun and engaging science education by bringing learnings from the gaming industry into the education sector mads both of us strongly believe that future innovations in science will contribute to solve major global challenges such as climate change the energy shortage as well as diseases like cancer or diabetes in order to achieve this we strive to inspire thousands of students all over the world to study science and eventually create innovative solutions for the challenges we face today what is your main motivation for working on labster mads our main motivation stems from seeing students excited about science education and helping them learn faster how do we do that basically we are trying to solve two challenges that i encountered when i was studying science myself firstly i realized during my studies that most people find science interesting if it is presented in a good way for instance when the teacher would focus on case stories ethic dilemmas useful technologies etc most fellow students i knew however found science extremely boring not because of the science itself but because of the traditional way it was being taught secondly i experienced firsthand how resourceintensive it can be when performing experiments in laboratories when i was doing research at harvard university even today as a teacher and researcher in biotechnology i still see the many limitations of the currently available tools for teaching science effectively we created labsters virtual laboratory technology and educational 3d software based on these two insights that you can reach and motivate far more people to study science when the material is fascinating and laboratories are accessible for every student and thats exactly what we can do at labster we can bring the best possible science education education that is otherwise only used at the worlds top universities to primary and high schools all over the world what do you think is the secret to innovation michael creativity and strong will power to change the world nearly all our innovation at labster comes from the creativity workshops we organize during these workshops we brainstorm how we can further improve the educational experience within our products then we gather all the ideas from everyone in the team as well as from the teachers we work with next we test out the ideas methodically we apply the lean startup approach and evaluate the ideas through focus groups where we invite students in for pizza and beers many ideas fail when tested out in real life and thats where the will power to change and innovate comes in as we often see 10 ideas fail before 1 good idea proves successful in increasing the learning outcome for the students what did you want to be when you were sevenyearsold michael superman and i still do i want to save the world michael you are a serial entrepreneur and on the board of several of your ventures from where do you draw energy in your life michael throughout my life ive seen and heard from thousands of people that they are inspired and positively impacted by my work and ideas i think its very important to listen takein and accept all this positive feedback and appreciation you get from people around you and then to mentally link it up to as the result of all the hard work you do every day this rather simple mind trick is the main motivating factor for me and i often remind myself of these moments and even overdramatize the huge positive impact my work will have in the future to give me extra energy and passion for everything i do besides this i write down my top goals what im truly grateful for and how i can further improve myself every single morning which gives me an amazing boost of excitement for the day ahead what do you want to achieve in the next year what in the next 10 years mads in the next year we are focusing on getting labster out to as many users as possible and we are in the process of expanding our sales and partnership team in the next 10 years we want to expand our elearning platform and be the leading platform for highly effective online learning games with a large impact on the motivation and skilllevel of science students and scientists globally what is the single best piece of advice you would give to a young entrepreneur with ambitions to change the world michael believe in yourself never doubt for a second that you can do it if steve jobs bill gates mark zuckerberg richard branson could all do it with nothing to begin with then you can too mads contact advisors and successful entrepreneurs for mentorship be careful on taking advice from nonentrepreneurs who think they know what is best sometimes their advice can be dangerous do you have a favorite quote what is it michael i have so many favorites as an entrepreneur i especially love this one there is nothing you cannot do only things you havent learned to do yet who truly inspires you and if you could ask this person one question what would it be michael richard branson and i would ask him who truly inspires you

politics former vice president mike pence said friday that he didnt take any classified information with him when he left office the disclosure which would typically be unremarkable for a former vice president is notable given that fbi agents seized classified and top secret information from his former bosss florida estate on aug 8 while investigating potential violations of three different federal laws former president donald trump has claimed that the documents seized by agents were all declassified pence asked directly if he had retained any classified information upon leaving office told the associated press in an interview no not to my knowledge despite the inclusion of material marked top secret in the governments list of items recovered from maralago pence said i honestly dont want to prejudge it before until we know all the facts pence was in iowa on friday as part of a two daytrip to the state which hosts the leadoff republican presidential caucuses it comes as the former vice president has made stops in other early voting states as he takes steps toward mounting a 2024 white house campaign pence also weighed in on republican us rep liz cheneys primary defeat earlier in the week to a rival backed by trump cheney who is arguably trumps most prominent republican critic has called the former president a very grave threat and risk to our republic and further raised his ire through her role as vice chair of the house committee investigating the jan 6 2021 insurrection at the us capitol my reaction was the people of wyoming have spoken said pence who was targeted at the capitol that day by angry rioters including some who chanted hang mike pence and you know i accept their judgment about the kind of representation they want on capitol hill pence said he has great respect for cheneys father former vice president dick cheney who served two terms under president george w bush and i appreciate the conservative stance congresswoman cheney has taken over the years pence continued but ive been disappointed in the partisan taint of the jan 6 committee from early on pences aides said the committee contacted his legal team months ago to see if he would be willing to testify although pence has said he would give due consideration to cooperating he was adamant that the historic nature of such participation must be warranted and agreed upon beyond my concerns about the partisan nature of the jan 6 committee there are profound constitutional issues that have to be considered he said no vice president has ever been summoned to testify before the congress of the united states speaking further about the search of maralago the former vice president raised the possibility as he has previously that the investigation was politically motivated and called on attorney general merrick garland to disclose more details on what led authorities to conduct the search the concern that millions of americans felt is only going to be resolved with daylight pence said friday i know thats not customary in an investigation but this is unprecedented action by the justice department and i think it merits an unprecedented transparency the jan 6 insurrection marked the first in a number of public breaks between trump and his once devout no 2 but pence has been careful not to alienate republicans who have supported trump but might be looking for another candidate in the 2024 election despite his reluctance to criticize the former president pence has occasionally spoken out against trump criticizing the attack at the us capitol and more recently urging his fellow republicans to stop lashing out at the fbi over the search of maralago the republican party is the party of law and order pence said wednesday at a political breakfast in new hampshire our party stands with the men and women who stand on the thin blue line at the federal and state and local level and these attacks on the fbi must stop we remain committed to providing you

health rejections hurtsliterally research shows an overlap in how our brains respond to rejection and physical pain why humans have a fundamental need to belong we have evolved to be part of a group part of a tribe says psychologist ben michaelis phd creator of one minute diagnosis which aims destigmatize mental illness without our tribes we cant survive when we experience rejection it taps into our ancient fears of being left out or rejected from our tribes which once upon a time actually did mean death but most of the rejection we face on a daily basis is not life or death this outdated fear keeps us firmly planted in our comfort zonewhich in turn prevents us from taking risks and stifles growth to truly thrive its crucial to embrace fear and rejectionproof yourself just ask jia jiang when jia jiang turned 30 he felt personally and professionally stuck he longed to make a radical change yet every time he felt the urge to speak up or try something new he smacked up against his biggest fear rejection in his nowfamous tedx talk what i learned from 100 days of rejection jiang recounts overcoming this barrier to success by purposefully seeking out opportunities to be rejected he started by asking a stranger for 100and was promptly turned down jiang didnt let that stop him making untraditional requestsget a burger refill be a starbucks greeter plant a flower in someones yardevery day for 100 days the more risks he took the easier it got while he was surprised by how often people said yes jiang explains that he felt more confident with each ask regardless of the responsebecause rejection itself lost its sting do you have to start asking strangers for money or inquiring about burger refills to be rejectionproof nope but you can try these 4 ways to say no to rejection 1 separate fear of rejection from rejection itself its hard to hear no especially when the stakes are high and youre emotionally involved with the outcome like applying for a job or asking someone out on a date but the fear is worse why because every time you step out of your comfort zone rejection is not a guaranteed conclusion when fear drives your decision making it will consistently keep you from doing what you want to do challenge that fear with a mantra such as rejection does not define me or i am more afraid of not trying than i am of failing 2 keep your radar in check jiang realized that what he was ultimately afraid of was feeling judgedand so a crucial part of the process was to engage with each person he talked to even if their initial response was to reject him what he found was that regardless of the request they most often wanted to know why why did he want that 100 or to get a haircut from a pet groomer or to take a nap in a mattress store when he stayed long enough to get to why he sometimes got a yes the fear of being judged by others comes down to your embarrassment radar the key is to stop your radar ive lost standing in someones eyes from getting in the way of your goals when you go looking for something you often find itmeaning you end up feeling judged more than warranted and more afraid to take risks next time you feel your embarrassment radar pinging stop for a moment and check if its accurate will this person really think of less of me if i ask fordo this nine times out of ten it wont be 3 practice with lowstakes requests you wont wake up one day and declare i will no longer fear rejection thats not how you defuse your fears or build your resilience remember jiang started by asking for 100 he didnt need it was only by making small requests that could get rejected and sometimes did that jiangs resilience got stronger and he was less intimidated by the prospect of a no so start small rather than starting with the most outrageous request you can think up make a practice of asking for small things that you might not get and remember that no doesnt have to mean flatout rejection it might just means not right now 4 get perspective no matter who you are rejection will cause a pang of negative emotions says michaelis after you have a chance to digest your feelings think about what you have learned from being rejected most of the time there is some lesson in there for you it could mean that you need to think differently or pivot or make a personal change but no matter what there is a lesson in rejection you just

social before visiting a school in kansas i stopped by the topeka schoolhouse museum dedicated to the desegregation case brown v board of education decided in 1954 before visiting a school in arkansas i stopped by the iconic central high school integrated by the little rock nine in 1959 so before visiting a school an hour north of memphis last week naturally i went to the national civil rights museum at the lorraine hotel the site of the 1968 assassination of martin luther king jr that is all to say that the history of the civil rights movement and its decadeslong quest for equal rights and educational quality was at the top of my thoughts when i stood in the hallway of covington high school during morning announcements school morning announcements are usually a list of club and sports activities but marcus heaston told me later that when hed become principal hed wanted to do something that would set the tone for the day so every day including the day i was there heaston tells his students to keep in mind the many men and women who sacrificed their lives and money and resources to secure their right to a free and equal education and who made this the greatest country on earth it is 2014 he says and we are truly judged by the content of our character displayed by how we dress and how we act and the decisions we make we all make mistakes he tells the students and invites each of them to make a decision that day to live a more characterfilled life to understand the power of his message it might help to understand a little of the context of the school covington is the city school of tipton county heaston himself an african american graduate of covington high school told me that the school has suffered from a long period of white flight by families who could afford to transport their kids to the county schools for a long time covington has been the school attended by black students and white students who couldnt afford to leave at the same time the area suffered a loss of industry and the school suffered ten years ago the schools academic achievement was low and current staff members who were there then describe the school as nearly out of control the students they told me lacked respect and didnt want to learn today the student body is on the move graduation rates have risen to a very impressive 96 percent and college enrollment rates are rising math achievement rates are far above the state and reading achievement is on the rise the makeup of the student body hasnt changed its still covington heaston says about half the students are african american and half are white threequarters meet the qualifications for free and reducedprice meals but heaston said many dont apply were very high poverty he told me adding that many of his students suffer from a variety of ills that is why he said he tells his students in that morning announcement that bad things happen to everyone but that we can choose to live a joyful life or a bitter one where we hang onto bad things that keep us from growing and learning heastons announcement is a way of establishing that everyone in the building is valued and expected to do important work work that was made possible not only by the civil rights movement but as he told me later by the entirety of american history from its colonial fight against tyranny onward when i talked with teachers and staff later they told me that the announcements backed up with many other things that build a supportive academic culture have made a difference and they are seizing the opportunity to make instruction more rigorous they embrace common core state standards and helping students think about their next steps whether it be twoyear college fouryear college or technical training in other words teachers are working hard to improve instruction but heaston says bad culture trumps good curriculum every time so he has worked very hard to build a good culture where students feel welcomed respected and valued he loves us i was told by many students white and black hell do anything for us and this year a few middleclass white kids trickled back from the county schools not many but a handful of sophomores in the fall and a couple more during the year attracted by the dramatic improvement in students academic achievement culture may beat curriculum as heaston says but culture plus curriculum is a powerful force indeed sixty years after brown v board of education as both the south and the north have settled back into racial isolation it might be the only force that can move us forward
health i love yoga actually i dont just love yoga i love love love yoga i love yoga culture i love yoga inspirational sayings i love yoga clothing i love the concept of mindfulness living that often accompanies the yoga practice with its emphasis on connecting mind body and soul we live in a world that encourages compartmentalization so i appreciate pondering the concept of greater interconnectedness i love waking up in the morning and going online and reading all of the yogainspired quotes posted on my facebook timeline from yogis around the world each sharing ways that i can unblock my chakras and live a more balanced life i love my beautiful mint green lululemon yoga mat sure i had to choose between paying my sons college tuition and buying this mat but when i see it all rolled up and majestically leaning into the corner of my bedroom gently reflecting the soft light streaming in from my window i know i made the right choice i love the yoga body strong long lean and healthy i love the yoga diet clean and organic with no gimmicks but more importantly i love the yoga wardrobe particularly the pants i love how yoga pants make me feel when i slide my yoga pants on in the morning and pull them up to my midtummy i immediately feel thinner gone is the muffin top i must constantly mask when wearing my lowrise jeans gone is the feeling of rigid cloth cutting into my sides from my optimistic imgoingtofitintothesepantssomedaydammit work slacks yoga pants gently hug me in a way that says let me do the work for you and ill do it gently so relax my dear youre nearly perfect just the way you are at last count i had 16 pairs of yoga pants and about 12 yoga tops although im not as much of a fan of my yoga tops particularly those with cutout backs i find those a bit well judgey i love everything yoga well not necessarily everything to date i havent completely fallen in love with the actual practice of yoga dont get me wrong ive tried i mean ive really really tried but ive found that engaging in the practice of yoga and by that i mean going to yoga classes and attempting to make my body comply with the commands of the sizezero yoga instructor isnt nearly as nurturing and comforting as everything else yoga for instance many of the yoga poses called asanas make me feel inept uncoordinated and kind of clunky while some positions are a breeze such as childs pose where i get to curl up in a ball with outstretched arms resting my head on my mat other positions require a level of coordination and flexibility that precirca 2010 would have been reserved for an opening act at the circus but more on that later i refuse to be intimidated into sitting on the sidelines any longer though and after years of immersing myself in all things yoga except yoga i finally decided to take the plunge and attend a real live yoga class when i walked into the yoga room for the first time i looked around to get my bearings and i noticed mostly women spread somewhat haphazardly around the room i quickly discerned the culture of mat placement and quietly padded to an open spot toward the back of the room hoping not to disrupt the meditative silence in the room i quietly unfurled my beloved mat with a loud flap that im certain could be heard in the parking lot and placed it onto the floor in what i assumed to be close enough to the adjacent mats so as not appear to be a floor hog but far enough away to avoid violating anyones personal space i looked around the room for guidance and noticed my fellow yogis sitting in what used to be called indian style but in the yoga world is referred to as the half lotus position i used to love sitting this way as a child crosslegged with my feet resting on the opposite thigh turned upward toward the sky not so now any attempt to pull my feet inward toward the opposing thigh was met with ugly popping sounds and the skin on my thighs threatening to tear wide open still i managed to pull off what i like to call the onefifth lotus position proud that i had mastered my first asana i placed my hands on my knees palms up and following my yoga mates lead i started breathing deeply the yoga instructor had at some point entered the room and taken her place in the front of the class breathe she gently admonished getting ready for our sacred time here today lets start by settling our minds by getting in touch with our breath clear your mind and just focus on your deep breathing deep breath in deep breath out i have to do laundry deep breath in deep breath out i need to pay the cable bill deep breath in deep breath out i wonder if my debit card was one of the ones hacked at the grocery store deep breath in deep breath out my son needs new socks deep breath in deep breath out i forgot to get gas now it was time for some real yoga which relieved me because i was starting to feel almost high from all that deep breathing and my stress level was now through the roof apparently all that shallow breathing and static in my brain served as a deterrent from thinking about my very long todo list the next 45 minutes of this introductory class was spent teaching us basic poses repeat basic poses after about five minutes though i began to wonder if id accidentally entered the wrong class because there was nothing about these poses that seemed introductory and whats worse i appeared to be the only one struggling whew i spoke too soon in the mirror i could see another fumbling fool ha i thought shes worse that i am oh wait no thats me the instructor used sanskrit names so we could get used to calling each pose by its correct indian name but unfortunately i have no head for languages so i couldnt discern adho mukha vnsana downward facing dog from ardha matsyendrsana spine twisting pose to save my life with each pose of what seemed to be of increasing complexity i no sooner managed to twist and contort my body that the instructor announced a new asana willing bodies complied throughout the room all except mine that is while my coyogis were gracefully engaging in perfectly formed downward facing dogs i was creating new positions such as the sidewaysfacingbackwardsfallingstray and while my fellow yogis were transitioning to warrior 1 pose with a smooth thrust of their leg in one uninterrupted and graceful forwarddriving swing i was teetering on tiptoes in an attempt to create as much room as possible willing my leg forward in three inch increments in what i like to call the stutteringstomachhaltinglegthrust when the instructor gave us a muchneeded water break i sat uncomfortably in my onefifthlotus position dying of thirst but with no water in hand dammit i knew i forgot something when the instructor told everyone to grab their blocks i quietly arose and feeling terribly embarrassed tiptoed my way through a minefield of mats to the back corner of the room where yoga blocks were stacked to the ceiling ahhh so thats what everyone was doing back here before class clearly i didnt belong it was like eighth grade all over again where i was still wearing late60s style hiphugger bellbottom pants long after 1970s dittos jeans were all the rage or keeping within the athletic realm it was like the 1980s when i was the only person in step aerobics without hightop reeboks and leg warmers or the 1990s when i was the only one in my jazzercize class with completely rhythmless hips i had no business being in this room i told myself ticking off one reason after another i wasnt thin enough i wasnt graceful enough i wasnt limber enough i hated being new i hated feeling out of place i hated feeling selfconscious yet another life experience where it seemed that everyone knew what they were doing but me truth be told i have suffered from the impostor syndrome the belief that one is a fraud and does not deserve success for as long as i can remember i used to let the impostor syndrome stop me in my tracks in whatever new endeavor i was trying to master whether in my career or in my personal life i used to believe that feeling out of place lost and having no idea what i was doing was a sign that i was unwelcome and would never belong where that outofplace feeling served as a sort of do not enter sign warning me to turn around and skedaddle back in the other direction but life circumstances have prevented me from remaining within my comfort zone and forced me to realize that being comfortable at all times is often a luxury that only the chronically indulged andor passionless can afford financial struggles when my son was younger pushed me into university teaching long before i was ready the need for a more flexible schedule higher income and a life of meaning forced me to push past my fear of entering a phd program when i was well into my 40s a desire to share my life with someone special has forced me back into the dating world during my empty nesting years with many new venture in life i have managed to endure feelings of discomfort by convincing myself that being out of my comfort zone was just a temporary phase and before i knew it those uncomfortable feelings were gone and i belonged maybe tackling yoga was just a matter of applying the strategies that ive employed in other areas of my life such as my career or personal life to the world of yoga where an asana is nothing more or nothing less than projects i accomplished at work concepts i mastered in my graduate work or fears i face in my personal growth journey the truth is that regardless of the situation or life domain there is no new endeavor worth mastering that doesnt leave one initially feeling out of place and out of ones comfort zone i could have walked out of that yoga class and never gone back i could have continued on my path of embracing all things yoga except the actual practice of yoga but instead i am sitting with my discomfort and intermittent embarrassment and letting my chakras evolve at their own pace because after all the living tradition of yoga isnt just about a series of perfectly practiced poses but rather yogas ultimate goal is to help people become aware of and connected to their deepest nature and in this crazy and hectic world of conflicting messages most of which are negative i think the world needs more yoga i know i do today i may feel like a yoga impostor as i attempt the tree pose vrksasana or what i like to call the tiiiiiiibertreepose but i trust that i wont always feel this way while i may never reach the advanced level of yoga where i can do the handstand pose adho mukha vrksasana with ease i will in time feel comfortable enough to know that i belong in a yoga studio as much as anyone else trusting that the feelings of discomfort in any new adventure are just a part of the process something to endure something to get past something that everyone experiences to some extent and so with hands clasped together and raised to my heart i say to all yogis and futureyogis alike namaste
sports major league baseball and its players union tentatively reached an agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement wednesday night the league announced in a news release the new agreement would stretch for the next five years extending baseballs period of labor peace through the end of the 2021 season players and owners had until just before midnight wednesday to reach a deal or agree to extend negotiations before the old agreement expired mlb owners and the mlb players association under the leadership of former player and current executive director tony clark are still working to finalize terms of the new bargaining agreement which will be subject to a vote from players and owners once it is complete but that should now be a formality according to reports the framework of the new deal largely resembles the old one after the most controversial and contentious issues died at the bargaining table there wont be for instance a new international draft for foreignborn prospects as owners had wanted but players fought vehemently neither will the deal expand the size of regular season rosters we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again baseballs negotiation process dragged on longer than many thought it would given the sports financial health reports in recent weeks hinted at the possibility of a lockout if the two sides couldnt reach a new deal but in the end the two sides avoided a work stoppage for the fourth consecutive time since players launched what became a 232day strike that stretched across the 1994 and 1995 seasons and baseballs unprecedented period of labor peace seems set to last for at least five more years
health in early march just before california put out a stayathome order writer and educator rachelle cruzs parents were taking the bart train back to their home in hayward in the san francisco bay area after a long day at work in the city the couple owns a small remittance business with a largely filipino and migrant clientele who send a portion of their wages back to their home countries to protect themselves from the growing threat of covid19 the couple were wearing masks it drew attention all of a sudden another passenger yelled at them telling them to go back to their country cruz told huffpost the person called my filipino mother a chinese coronavirus bitch and said that both of my parents are bearers of the virus they stopped taking the bart train last week a day shy of the lockdown in san francisco when cruz asked her mother if it was ok that she shared the story with huffpost she agreed with one request my mother wanted to clarify that this was the third racist incident shes personally experienced or witnessed on the train in the last few weeks cruz said my parents are now working from home where my mother misses her clients but not the racists on the train encounters like those experienced by cruzs parents have become commonplace for asian americans in the wake of the current global public health emergency because covid19 originated in wuhan china asian americans have been widely scapegoated regardless of whether theyre chinese or not asian americans indonesians chinese koreans thai filipinos and others arent a monolith but for americans with bigoted views that hardly matters asian americans of every descent are dealing not only with the virus itself but verbal and physical violence from xenophobic neighbors the choice to wear a mask or not is widely debated among friends and relatives do you wear one to protect yourself from the virus or does it draw unnecessary attention the encounters are not unlike what american muslims and other arabs and south asians experienced after the september 11 terrorist attacks while president trump finally called for asian americans to be protected on march 23 he failed to acknowledge the part hes played in their vilification he continues to interchangeably call covid19 the chinese virus even as the world health organization warns against the shorthand he even changed his own news conference script to reflect that a viral photograph shows the word corona crossed out and replaced with chinese in the presidents handwriting at least one member of his staff reportedly joked that it was the kung flu given all that its not really surprising that a bipartisan pair of house lawmakers recently unveiled a resolution that blames china for causing a global pandemic and calls on the chinese government to publicly declare that covid19 began there but words matter and have the potential to stoke an already racially charged american landscape a videotaped attack on an asian man collecting recyclables in san francisco in late february sparked outrage and gave a glimpse into what was to come on march 10 a korean woman in midtown manhattan was confronted on the street by somebody yelling where is your corona mask you asian bitch before punching the woman and dislocating her jaw a week later in queens new york a father walking with his 10yearold son was harassed by a person yelling where the fuck is your mask you fucking chinese before being struck over the head and on march 14 a man was arrested after stabbing a burmese man and his young son in a sams club in midland texas graphic photos on social media show the boy with a huge gash reaching from behind his ear all the way across to his eye stereotypes unfortunately are only intensified when president trump uses terms like chinese virus which indirectly suggest that asians are to blame there are no official numbers on hate crimes yet but san francisco state university found a 50 rise in the number of news articles related to the coronavirus and antiasian discrimination between feb 9 and march 7 the anxiety triggered by stories like this has many asian americans glad to follow stayathome orders given what could await them at their local supermarkets in public theyre fearful of what an errant cough or wearing a mask might do said therese mascardo a psychologist of filipino descent who works within the asian american community asians are experiencing reluctance to seek medical care when they are ill for fear that they will confirm stereotypes about asians being more responsible for spreading the virus she said this is called a stereotype threat which refers to the risk of confirming a negative stereotype about ones social group this stereotype is unfortunately only intensified when president trump uses terms like chinese virus which indirectly suggest that asians are to blame mascardo said the h1n1 swine flu pandemic that infected up to 14 billion people and killed up to 575000 originated in factory farmed pigs in the united states yet nobody ever calls it the american pig flu lets stop calling the coronavirus the chinese virus were all in this together vivian shaw a postdoctorate sociologist at harvard university is collecting stories documenting xenophobia and racism related to coronavirus looking at the uptick of stories shes received she too believes trumps rhetoric is fueling these racially charged encounters she also believes its a highly calculated move on the presidents part trumps current stoking of xenophobic populism is his way of signaling that the lives of asian americans and pacific islanders are useful to the us insofar as they provide a way for the administration to sidestep its utter mishandling of this disaster she said the violent incidents against asian americans make headlines but theres also heavyhanded microaggressions sideways glances in the market rushing out of an elevator when a person of asian descent gets in and verbal abuse to contend with in interviews over the past week readers told huffpost that such experiences have become an everyday part of life on march 11 filipinx poet kay ulanday barrett was taking a flight home from denver co to newark nj barrett whos disabled and often wears a mask due to asthma sat down early for preboarding given their disability while getting on the plane a few white people looked at me with obvious disgust there were eye rolls and exasperated ughs barrett told huffpost one person even looked my way and called me gross it was degrading the writer said the comments i used to get about wearing a mask were ones of curiosity but in these cases white people felt completely ok commenting on a total stranger it was like my humanity or feelings didnt matter jon yoon a musician who lives in seattle said that in late february his 18year old daughter had gone to a joanns fabrics to get some knitting supplies while shopping she encountered a hostile older white woman the woman got into her face saying you cant be here you could have corona yoon said my daughter was shocked confused and uncomfortable and tried to avoid this woman but she wouldnt leave her alone and continued employees witnessed the verbal attack and immediately ejected the woman from the store in the parking lot the woman found another target in an asian family getting out of their car she went straight toward them saying the same racist things shed told my daughter yoon said she even had the nerve to deliberately spit on them the family was in shock and store employees quickly called the police on march 16 matthew l a business analyst from new york was at crunch fitness in the financial district when a fellow gymgoer made comments about the city going on lockdown and singled him out your people and your government caused this the man told matthew i was confused at first but after realizing he was instigating me i got in his face and returned the same energy back matthew said he went on more about how the chinese brought that dirty virus over here and when i didnt back down the argument turned physical i got spit on my face and shirt then a minor fight ensued its really disheartening to see these comments by the dozen come up in my inbox just because i am asian and to see that many treat this virus as a joke or feel that their racism is justified matthew left the altercation without serious injuries and alerted the crunch staff to what had happened and a good samaritan stepped in to let the other man know what he did was fucked up matthew said online where people are emboldened by the anonymity of comment sections the taunts and racial slurs are commonplace before the stayathome orders were put out trang dong a uc berkeley student filmed a video where she and her cousin were goofily eating pho on tiktok as fears about the coronavirus intensified dong said the nasty comments began pouring in it was oh theyre eating bat soup and lots of coronavirus check comments simply for us just being asian she said its really disheartening to see these comments by the dozen come up in my inbox just because i am asian and to see that many treat this virus as a joke or feel that their racism is justified when she considers how asian americans are treated versus italian americans in italy deaths from covid19 have exceeded chinas dong gets a little frustrated ive seen no antiitalian rhetoric surrounding their culture and food she said most posts ive seen shared from italy are the signs of unity as citizens sing together from their balconies whereas news about china is repeatedly portrayed in a negative light its a vicious double standard that is only hurting asian communities i planned to go out for groceries today and this gives me pause so sorry this happened to you jeff httpstcoiwvlsltylh reactions to such casual offhand racism inevitably vary thats understandable said gabrielle zhuangestrin a clinical social worker who works in the asian american community in los angeles its daunting and overwhelming to respond to someone who is profiling you or using abusive racist language she said if it happens to you remember that your response whatever it is is the right response perhaps you ignore the assailant perhaps you walk away perhaps you engage and tell them you see them for what they are doing being racist accepting how you handled the encounter in the moment is important zhuangestrin said because you dont want to deal with that pang of guilt or concern that you havent handled the situation right on top of everything else talk about it online too to distance themselves and combat some of the xenophobia asian americans have started a iamnotavirus campaign in france jenesuispasunvirus has been trending we are not diseased we are not scapegoats we are not a virus we are asianamericans tired of the antiasian sentiment from covid19 tell your story and join the collective of panasian youth retaking our narrative iamnotavirus pictwittercomtqq8ykdf2e hearing others stories can be heartening especially when youre doubting the validity of your own experiences mascardo said its important because when under attack its easy to secondguess oneself or minimize the act she said you might think did that really happen or was it all in my head maybe it wasnt really that big of a deal she said online communities nextsharkcom or the facebook group subtle asian traits can serve as sources for support and validation mascardo said for those who arent asian american be an ally and speak up against injustice earlier this month a viral video showed people on a train in the uk defending an asian woman who was being racially harassed for wearing a mask to protect herself as a cancer survivor responding thoughtfully in the moment like the traingoers is huge especially if you have bystander training but allyship can also just mean checking in on your asian american friends to see how theyre doing mascardo said we remain

technology hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this week in apple rumors our regular look back at all of the weeks unconfirmed gossip questionably sourced reports and blatant speculation about future apple products from around the web lets take a look back at what the various apple blogs and websites were excited about in the past week from feb 23march 1 check out our previous edition of apple rumors here and for all the latest you can follow me on twitter right here 1 yet another analyst predicts the next iphone will debut in augustseptember 2013 iphone shoppers wondering when the next model will be arriving its looking a little more likely that yo christmas will be coming early as yet another analyst has predicted some heavenly light in august for apple fans welcome back to this week in apple rumors where were cramming nonsensical faulkner puns into the first sentence and transcribing yet another prediction that the nextgeneration iphone the iphone 5s wed guess will be appearing in august or september or about a year after the introduction of the iphone 5 on september 12 this time around its barclays analyst kirk yang thats landed on our radar for predicting that the next iphone would land in august or september along with a cheaper iphone aimed at emerging markets yang didnt have any other juicy details about the phone itself the release date is the thing to watch here that augustseptember prognostication puts him in line with a growing squad of applewatchers calling for a julyaugustseptember release including mingchi kuo of kgi securities jeremy horwitz of ilounge piper jaffrays gene munster and peter misek of jeffries kuo and horwitz are the two prognosticatorstowatch theyve proven to be accurate in the past unlike misek and munster mm as they are known in the apple community of my mind by june we should be getting a very clear sense of apples timeline for the iphone 5s if you can hold out that long without upgrading its probably worth waiting 2 will the iphone mini prove to be a 45inch screen monster since the dawn of man or since the first iphone was released apple has been rumored to release a cheaper iphone along with it to entice buyers in emerging markets like china and like the longawaited third movie in the mortal kombat film trilogy it hasnt happened yet theres been a ton of renewed chatter about such an iphone mini or iphone nano in the past couple of months though with several analysts convinced that apple is finally going to put one out this time around 2013 is going to be the year they cry their eyes full of hope and innocence weve heard rumors about how such a phone would cut costs a plastic body is probably the most popular suggestion and what it might look like heres a fresh one the japanese apple blog macotakara claims that apple is pushing its cheaper iphone back to 2014 and that rather than a smaller phone its iphone mini will actually contain a 45inch screen or 05inches larger than the current iphone 5 display appleinsider has more obviously this conflicts with the cw surrounding the release timeframe and the size of the iphone mini also obviously the cw on the iphone mini has been wrong every year dating back to 2007 were still waiting for more solid information especially given macotakaras somewhat inaccurate past 3 are we going to see the first iphones in color this summer leaving this here as a mere curiosity but a persistent rumor about the cheaper iphone is that apple is going to make it available in different colors similar to what nokia does with the lumia 920 and what mars inc does with skittles this week apple bitch real website name noticed that apple posted a new job who says were in a recession looking for an anodizing engineer or a lady or gent who could add color to aluminum the job posting is here and theres no mention of the iphone apple could be looking to replace someone in the ipod division the ipod already comes in many colors like the coat of joseph so this is pure unsourced irredeemable speculation but isnt it fun especially when we have mockups of what a colored iphone might look like below 4 ipad 5 cases already popping up in china one of the quirks of the apple rumor mill is that cases for nonexistent products often leak months before the products actual release date as the factories that work on those products leak internal specs to casemakers in china these case leaks have proven accurate before so lets not write this one off too quickly supposed cases of the nextgeneration ipad which apple will call the ipad and which everyone else will call the ipad 5 popped up on international marketplace alibaba last week you can view them below what can they tell us what do they whisper into our ears about the future ipad once again discovered by apple bitch twice in one column i get to mention apple bitch and there is nothing nothing my editor can do about it theres nothing particularly revealing about these cases there is a slot for the lightning connector and the width and height appears to be about the same as the current generation of ipad the one potentiallyintriguing aspect of the cases is the reduced bezel size the ipad will reportedly take design cues from the ipad mini which has much thinner bezels or bevels again not exactly david beckham super bowl commercial sexiness here but its something the presence of these cases doesnt really tell us anything about a release date timeframe for the next ipad though it is generally assumed it will arrive in the secondhalf of this year it is with my deepest apologies that i inform you that i lack a faulkner pun to drive home this final bit of nonnews if only there were some quote associated with faulkner to describe a loud flashy event that in the end signifies very little thats all for this weeks edition of this week in apple rumors make sure you join us again next week or if you want to get apple rumors as they break you can get all the latest by

worldnews united nations ap the uns two major bodies the 193nation general assembly and the more powerful 15member security council will hold separate meetings monday on russias invasion of ukraine a reflection of widespread international demands for an immediate ceasefire and escalating concern for the plight of millions of ukrainians caught up in the war the security council gave a green light sunday for the first emergency session of the general assembly in decades it will give all un members an opportunity to speak about the war monday and vote on a resolution later in the week that us ambassador linda thomasgreenfield said would hold russia to account for its indefensible actions and for its violations of the un charter french ambassador nicolas de riviere announced that the security council will hold a meeting monday afternoon on the humanitarian impact of russias invasion a session sought by french president emmanuel macron to ensure the delivery of aid to growing numbers of those in need in ukraine both meetings follow russias veto friday of a security council resolution demanding that moscow immediately stop its attack on ukraine and withdraw all troops the vote was 111 with china india and the united arab emirates abstaining de riviere said france and mexico will propose a draft resolution to demand the end of hostilities protection of civilians and safe and unhindered humanitarian access to meet the urgent needs of the population it said it will probably be put to a vote tuesday sundays vote in the security council on a resolution cosponsored by the united states and albania to authorize the general assembly session was exactly the same as on friday 111 and three abstentions but because council approval for such a session is considered a procedural vote there are no vetoes and the resolution got more than the minimum nine yes votes needed for approval last week ukraine asked for a special session of the general assembly to be held under the socalled uniting for peace resolution initiated by the united states and adopted in november 1950 to circumvent vetoes by the soviet union during the 195053 korean war that resolution gives the general assembly the power to call an emergency session to consider matters of international peace and security when the security council is unable to act because of the lack of unanimity among its five vetowielding permanent members the united states russia china britain and france the us ambassador told the council after sundays vote that members had taken an important step forward in holding russia accountable for its unjustifiable assault fabricated out of lies and the rewriting of history and now all nations can be heard in the general assembly we are alarmed by the mounting

resistance he said it is extremely alarming that the russian president has resorted today to open nuclear blackmail the world must take this threat very seriously russian ambassador vassily nebenzia

environment by environment correspondent alister doyle oslo dec 8 reuters a thaw of arctic ice and snow is linked to worsening summer heatwaves and downpours thousands of miles south in europe the united states and other areas underlying the scale of the threat posed by global warming scientists said on sunday their report which was dismissed as inconclusive by some other experts warned of increasingly extreme weather across much of north america and eurasia where billions of people will be affected the study is part of a drive to work out how climate change affects the frequency of extreme weather from droughts to floods governments want to know the trends to plan everything from water supplies to what crops to plant but the science of a warming arctic is far from settled writing in the journal nature climate change experts in china and the united states said they could not conclusively say the arctic thaw caused more extreme weather or vice versa but they said they had found evidence of a relationship between the two rising temperatures over thawing snow on land and sea ice in the arctic were changing atmospheric pressure and winds the report said the changes slowed the eastward movement of vast meandering weather systems and meant more time for extreme weather to develop such as a heatwave in russia in 2010 droughts in the united states and china in 2011 and 2012 or heavy summer rains that caused floods in britain in 2012 the paper added the study contributes to a growing body of evidence that the melting arctic has wideranging implications for people living in the middle latitudes lead author qiuhong tang of the chinese academy of sciences told reuters sea ice in the arctic shrank to a record low in 2012 and the uns panel of climate scientists says it could almost vanish in summers by 2050 with rising greenhouse gas emissions but some scientists said other factors including the usual vagaries of weather or changing sea temperatures may explain some recent extremes rather than changes in the arctic the jury is still very much out james screen an expert at exeter university in england said of efforts to see if there is a link between a melting arctic and extremes further south in the northern hemisphere some evidence in sundays study was plausible but far from conclusive he said adding that some of the data were not statistically significant and might be random variations for people on the streets what really matters is whether the extremes are changing or not but from the scientific perspective we want to understand why he said better understanding is vital to make reliable predictions in september the uns panel of climate scientists raised the probability that most global warming since 1950 has a human cause mostly gases released by burning fossil fuels to 95 percent from 90 in a previous assessment in 2007 we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again james overland of the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration said many extremes studied were in the past decade too short to know for sure if they were enhanced by arctic ice and snow melt or not sceptics remain unconvinced that arcticmidlatitude linkages are proven and this work will do little to change their viewpoint he wrote in a comment in nature climate change still he said there was a high potential for an arctic influence given the outlook for a further thaw reporting by alister doyle

health at least you can run i offered one of my kids middle school teachers was lamenting how middle age has slowed her pace she awakens at dawn runs from lower to upper manhattan every morning teaches middle schoolers math and science all day supervises afterschool and running club and then prepares for the next day yet this wonder woman was criticizing herself for her decline its true another middle school mother seated at a table with us added my late friend jennifer goodman linn the founder of cycle for survival loved to work out jennifer battled cancer for years she reminded people how happy she was on the days when she was able to run the mix of rumi wisdom and jewish disaster preparedness seemed to carry some truth i do need to remember to see the beauty of the trees and not worry as much about my time for each mile our kids teacher conceded that was last night then this morning as i was walking my son to school another parent called out its national running day that was it all forces were pointing me to putting those running sneakers back on my feet it has been a while i talk a good game about joining the cool group of running moms from ps 87 the elementary school my kids attended but when push comes to shove or to jog as the case may be i chuckle say one day soon and head home i have excellent excuses for not running i do yoga the impact on my almost halfcentury old knees and joints isnt good i have a hammer toe on my left foot its too hot cold humid wet or icy i need to take a nap if you read my piece on napping i have an update for you i do have a sleep disorder after all but the talk last night reminded me that i too can run so i put on the sneakers and headed out to central park im doing it i defied those tugging hamstrings and accelerated breathing i greeted the reservoir as if id returned to pals at a college reunion hello white lines of darkness my old friends ive come to talk with you again runs of past flooded my mind i realized the important moments ive experienced while running back in graduate school i was up to my ears in debt i ate cereal and pasta for dinner my roommate and i played a waiting game of who would buy the toilet paper first gym membership was out of the question so i ran i ran in the snow the rain the heat and it cleared my mind reading literary theory in the library all day i craved my runs as a time of release i could run virtually anywhere and at any time i wasnt foolish mind you i didnt run in new haven in the 1990s at night my body was mine in the early days of graduate school i admit that i held onto a very rich college boyfriend as a security blanket we traveled his family introduced me to fancy new york restaurants like the quilted giraffe where his father ordered us the beggars purse caviar appetizer for a supplement of 50 a piece in 1988 dollars his neediness appealed to my desire for admiration we both ran and were highly competitive about it it was that kind of relationship but he did teach me about running run along the reservoir in the days before the central park conservancy replaced the gritty grates with fine iron spokes when i visited him at his parents apartment on park avenue getting out to run took dedication dressed sloppily in black bike shorts and tee shirt i would have to pass a series of spectacularlyuniformed elevator operators lobby escorts and doormen before i could emerge in the open air and breathe freely youd think that sense of imprisonment might have clued me into the relationships dysfunction but it took until he broke up with me by cheating for the relationship to end alas youth after a few days of sobbing and feeling betrayed i went for a run it was terrific dare i say an epiphany to get some tlc i had driven from new haven to visit my parents in newton massachusetts as i had done for years i put on my sneakers and headed out on commonwealth avenue the very strip of the boston marathon called heartbreak hill although i ran down the hill the tears that had been clouding my eyes dried up with each step of foot on the pavement as my heart rate increased and my muscles loosened it dawned on me im free the run unleashed the inner truth id known for years i was strong and i could take myself where i needed to go running along the reservoir this morning i remembered other significant runs there were the panting attempts to make it around the loop just one time after the birth of each of my children how do these people walk so fast i marveled at almost everyone who sped by me on the sidewalk after i returned from the hospital the runs were a way of reclaiming my stomach muscles my independent body and my identity there was the run on sept 12 2001 the bright blue sunshine of the previous day still bathed new york although the air was starting to smell strange even on the upper west side we sat glued to the television most of the time but i needed to move i jogged around the reservoir in a daze and every conversation i overheard by fellow joggers was the same i still can hear peoples voices trying to make sense of what had happened i was running alone but we were all together we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the

newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again decades of runs in changing seasons with different friends and in various incarnations of myself fused into a grateful embrace during my run today like the middle school teacher i do run slower now but i also notice different things was the spraying water in the center of the reservoir always there did the tennis courts on the north side always look so inviting i wasnt comparing myself to other runners or even counting how many more yards i had to go i was simply running i have learned to become a lot more openminded about what constitutes exercise it used to be that if i didnt run five miles or take an intense 60minute spinning class it didnt count that has changed now every day i force myself to take a water aerobics class or ride for 20 minutes on a low resistance on my indoor bike if the weather is nice i take a walk and i always do some weight training although my 12pound weights have now been replaced by 5pound weights i still know its important to help prevent muscle atrophy
worldnews american policymakers must be smiling from ear to ear in a country with 56 million eligible voters more than 41 million saudis voted in their presidential elections last friday the 12th such election over the past 38 years despite a litany of obstacles arbitrarily imposed by unelected religious zealots 73 percent turnout served as a catalyst to reelect the pragmatist saudi president with 57 percent of the vote moreover reformists and moderates dominated city council elections across the kingdom in the city housing saudi arabias most holy religious shrine a woman won a council seat using the campaign slogan lets vote for women in one of the most conservative provinces 415 women won village and local council seats an increase from 185 in one village there were no men on the ballot at all of course none of this took place in saudi arabia americas longstanding partner of choice in the middle east rather than holding meaningful elections saudi arabia was fueling dangerous sectarianism rejecting diplomacy and preparing to instigate a conflict with its arab neighbor qatar iranians overwhelmingly chose to pursue peaceful indigenous change through the ballot box when juxtaposed with saudi arabia the contrast is stark the electoral outcomes mentioned above all happened in iran with whom the us has been at odds with since 1979 and as iranians danced in the streets to celebrate hassan rouhanis reelection donald trump danced to the steps of a war dance as he met with the leaders of saudi arabia and israel to denounce iran and call for its fullscale isolation to borrow from barack obama iranian society extended its hand to the world and the governments in washington riyadh and tel aviv responded with threatening clenched fists this highlights the biggest and most overlooked problem regarding trumps emerging policy on iran and the middle east at large americas continued obsession with regimes in the region at the expense of societies in the case of iran there is no denying the myriad political economic and social obstacles created by the government from indiscriminate vetting of electoral candidates to media censorship to inflated budgets for the security apparatus nor is it a regime that has been an exemplary actor in the region but then again no such actor exists in the region from israel who has occupied palestinian lands for more than 50 years to saudi arabia middle east powers all have blood on their hands western powers are no less innocent they instigated the invasion and occupation of iraq and have provided decadeslong support to authoritarian regimes who brutally repress their political economic and social dissent that is precisely why hope in the middle east lies not with the regimes but the societies and what irans society just achieved despite the obstacles it faces is remarkable rather than violently revolt engage in terrorism against the state or boycott elections that are neither free nor fair according to international best practices and standards iranians overwhelmingly chose to pursue peaceful indigenous change through the ballot box predicated on moderation at home and abroad when juxtaposed with saudi arabia the contrast is stark the kingdom does not permit meaningful elections therefore making assessments of saudi society more challenging certainly women have little say in driving the political agenda or indeed driving themselves not to mention that saudi arabia is the birthplace of both al qaeda and according the us government the source isiss seed money for its part israel is a real democracy where the undemocratic obstacles iranians face do not exist for israeli citizens yet its society produces results that are wildly different from what transpired last week in iran since 2001 israelis have voted for increasingly rightwing governments that double down on occupation launch wars of choice and reject international law as iranian society time and again rejects extremism from its government israeli society repeatedly elects it all of this highlights a dereliction of duty by successive us administrations sticking blindly to its regional partnerships without considering the conduct of their regimes or illiberal trends within their societies israeli rightwing extremism while ignoring the trends within societies of countries on americas enemy list has created a chaotic and contradictory web of relationships in the middle east that neither serve us interests nor are compatible with its values this does not mean that washington should end its working relationships with regional partners or turn a blind eye to its current conflict of interests with iran but it should recognize that the trends in irans society serves americas longterm interests as well as stability in the region continued enmity with iran because of americas current entanglement in antiquated middle east security partnerships risks costing the us not only a valuable friend in the future but it may also earn it a much more potent foe down the road as a more democratic iran is likely also going to be a more powerful iran iranians overcame significant undemocratic obstacles to cast their vote in favor of engagement meanwhile the saudi government chose to shut the door on diplomacy and bully qatar to acquiesce to riyadhs hardline on iran donald trump should not take iran or saudi arabias side in this conflict but his administration should recognize where the longterm source of moderation in the region is and that acquiescing to riyadhs rejection of dialogue makes the risk of america getting dragged into another war in the middle east all the more probable reza marashi is research director at the national iranian american council trita parsi is the president of the council and author of losing an enemy obama iran and the triumph of diplomacy
economy after a riotous week full of revelations that facebook enabled a shadowy british firm called cambridge analytica to harvest and exploit the personal information of more than 50 million users then failed to follow up on it for more than two years ceo mark zuckerberg offered an offcamera act of contrition wednesday yet no apology in the missive zuckerburg acknowledged theres been a breach of trust between facebook and its users he outlined several steps he hopes will restore public trust in the company all aimed at clarifying and restricting which apps have access to which types of data facebook also said it will investigate the apps on the platform that had access to large amounts of user data prior to 2014 before the company began limiting developers access it plans to ban those found to be in violation of facebooks terms and notify affected users including those affected by cambridge analytica we have a responsibility to protect your data and if we cant then we dont deserve to serve you wrote zuckerberg who is scheduled to appear in an interview on cnn wednesday night notably while zuckerberg acknowledges facebook made mistakes his post stops short of anything resembling an apology zuckerberg also failed to clarify how exactly cambridge analytica held onto and kept using the harvested data for a full two years after facebook learned cambridge had acquired it he does offer the feeble defense that facebook asked for and received a formal certification from the company verifying it deleted the data but it was clearly insufficient in a separate post chief operating officer sheryl sandberg went a step further stating she deeply regrets how facebook handled cambridge analytica but again its no apology you deserve to have your information protected and well keep working to make sure you feel safe on facebook she wrote your trust is at the core of our service we know that and we will work to earn it its been a response several days in the making as neither zuckerberg nor sandberg offered so much as a peep earlier this week as the allegations piled up and facebooks stock tanked both were absent from an internal briefing about the situation tuesday though they were never scheduled to appear in the first place and while zuckerberg was expected to speak at an allhands meeting friday it seems thats been bumped up a day or two translation of zuckerbergs wednesday post he is super serious you guys this time he promises itll be different not like last time in september when he appeared before cameras and pledged facebook would do a better job selfregulating and create a new standard for transparency in online political ads that particular acknowledgment was only prompted by the revelation that more than half of all eligible voters in the us were exposed to and interacted with russian propaganda on facebook between june 2015 and august 2017 or the time before that in july 2017 when a facebook spokesperson flatout told cnn we have seen no evidence that russian actors bought ads on facebook in connection with the election just two weeks later facebook revealed it had found more than 3000 such ads bought and paid for by a russian group known as the internet research agency making you angry making you afraid is really good for facebooks business it is not good for america its not good for the users of facebook or the time before that in november 2016 when zuckerberg dismissed as crazy the idea that misinformation spread via facebook could have influenced the election in any way thenpresident barack obama reportedly pulled zuckerberg aside a couple of days after he made the statement and warned he should take the threat of disinformation on the network seriously about a year after obamas warning zuckerberg wrote a mea culpa saying he regretted the statement this is too important an issue to be dismissive he said or the time before that during the first democratic primary of 2016 when roger mcnamee an early facebook investor said he warned zuckerberg and sandberg that people were being manipulated on the platform yet his concerns went unheeded they treated it like a public relations problem rather than a substantive issue for the business he said in a statement thats just as relevant today as it was then facebook has forcefully argued its fine policing itself since at least 2011 when the federal election commission first considered regulating political ads on the platform then backed down after being warned by company lawyers not to stand in the way of innovation we remain committed to

science when it comes to cracking nuts capuchins dont monkey around just have a look at this video showing a little monkey named jatob expertly crack a tucum nut five quick whacks and voila the video was taken as part of a new study on wildbearded capuchins cebus libidinosus living in the open woodland of piaui brazil until now this level of dexterity was not suspected of any monkey madhur mangalam a psychology graduate student at the university of georgia at athens and one of the researchers involved in the study said in a written statement for the study mangalam and her colleagues recorded 14 capuchins cracking nuts with a stone hammer and then analyzed the videos to determine the force of each strike to their surprise the scientists found that the monkeys dont simply whack a nut over and over until it breaks open instead they monkeys examine the nut after each strike and artfully adjust the amount of force they use so as to save their energy and prevent the nuts kernel from getting smashed it was a eureka moment when we realized that the monkeys modulated the strikes systematically according to the condition of the nut following the preceding strike mangalam said in the statement its not the first time scientists have been impressed by monkeys abilities previous research showed that monkeys can do math and even learn to spend money a paper describing the research was published on april 29 in the journal current biology
science figuring god into the world of science is a nebulous task what happens when observers of the factbased natural world must come to terms with the faithbased spirituality of the mystical world over the centuries scientists opinions have variedfrom a reconciliation of the two to a complete rejection of one or the other these days many scientists span a middle groundadmitting the possibility of an omnipotent force but refusing to assert one exists because well we just dont know below are science and religion quotes from 20 top scientists ranging from the founding fathers of science to modern researchers who chose to speak out about their religious beliefs and if you just cant get enough heres footage of 50 more famous scientists talking about god
technology this adapted excerpt is taken from a new book how to make a spaceship a band of renegades an epic race and the birth of private spaceflight by julian guthrie with a foreword by richard branson and an afterword by stephen hawking penguin press sept 20 2016 the new book tells the story of entrepreneur peter diamandis his idea for a 10 million space prize and the group of dreamers engineers rocket enthusiasts and aviation designers from across the globe who entered the race to become the first team to privately build and fly a rocket to the start of space peter diamandis arrived at the skybar a rooftop watering hole on sunset boulevard in los angeles with the idea of meeting two young guys who had struck it rich in the dot com boom peter whose lifelong dream had been to get man and machine to space without the governments help had heard these internet entrepreneurs were interested in space peter had never heard of the men before the meeting was arranged by a mutual friend so he wrote down their names adeo ressi and elon musk peter usually approached pitch meetings with great enthusiasm but tonight he felt subdued he spotted adeo by the skybar pool smoking a cigarette and looking out at the gold and glimmering los angeles sunset he was tall and thin a giacometti walking man figure and immediately affable adeo said elon was running late but on his way elon was working on getting his pilots license and was flying down from san jose with his instructor he had a new plane being built it was sunday june 3 2001 and adeo elon and peter were scheduled to have dinner at asia de cuba adjacent to the skybar in the mondrian hotel peter took in the beautiful women in filmy tops and short skirts and felt overdressed in his suit and mock turtleneck adeo was in casual slacks and a shirt open at the collar the music was pulsating the lychee up martinis flowing and the entire hotel was bathed in white with minimalist accents of herms orange even the matches were stylish with limegreen tips peter had taken notice of the whiteclad valet team when he pulled up to the whitefaade hotel the valet attendants all clasped their hands in exactly the same way peter joined adeo for a drink near the pool adeo had just sold his web development firm methodfive and was working on turnarounds of lagging public companies he said he and elon had been housemates at the university of pennsylvania elon was south african and had founded zip2 a mapping and business services company and cofounded paypal the online payment service being bought by ebay their shared interest in space came to light during a latenight car ride the weekend before memorial day as they drove back to new york city from long island on a cloudy night talk turned to what they wanted to do next as a joke one of them said why dont we do something in space when the laughter died down elon said well why cant we do something in space the debate went back and forth space was too expensive why was it so expensive space takes a lot of infrastructure why does it take so much infrastructure space is controlled by governments and strict regulation what happens if it is taken out of the governments hands finally they asked each other why do we even think space is interesting this led to a discussion of where they would go if they could go to space by the end of the car ride they had their answer about what to do next they knew exactly where they wanted to go before adeo could continue elon arrived and apologized for being late the three men moved with drinks in hand from the skybar to the restaurant and ordered a feast panseared ahi tuna miso grilled salmon the asian noodle box and more tracks from the buddha bar collection played in the background peter found elon immediately likable good chemistry from the start softspoken polite his words well chosen adeo was also great but more of an extrovert who seemed to enjoy playing devils advocate peter knew very little about the two coming into the nights dinner hed had a quick conference call the week before with elon and adeo thought they said all the right things and took elons accent to be british adeo made peter laugh knowingly when he said i think every geek is a bit of a space buff peter talked about his various space ventures including the xprize which he had launched five years earlier to try to jumpstart the private space industry by offering a 10 million prize for the first team that could build and fly a rocket to the start of space peter also talked about space adventures his company with eric anderson which had brokered the final part of the deal to send the worlds first space tourist dennis tito to the international space station aboard a russian soyuz spacecraft for 20 million peter talked briefly about how nasa had tried to stop tito from flying but tito had launched on april 28 and landed safely in kazakhstan on may 6 it was big news in space circles that tito an american had to fly with russian cosmonauts and was not allowed on the us side of the space station as peter talked about what the ultimate space company would look like putting on moon missions and suborbital and zerog flights elon and adeo said they had set their sights on something different something even more difficult they wanted to reach the red planet their mission decided that night on long island was to put humanity on mars they wanted to spend money to shame embarrass or prod the government into doing a human mission to mars peter cautioned that he had seen a lot of great missions fail because one wealthy backer or another expected other wealthy individuals to support his vision but every wealthy person has his own vision peter said to make such a mission work peter now believed one very wealthy and determined person would need to be willing to pay for everything something he had yet to encounter as elon listened to peter talk about blastoff and his other companies he thought peters heart was in the right place and it was obvious that he cared deeply about the future of space travel but the blastoff plan didnt make sense to him he didnt think sending a rover back to the moon was going to reignite space travel returning to the subject of mars elon said we want to do something thats significant enough but does something for a reasonable budgetfor a couple million adeo added that they had 10 million to 15 million to spend but wanted to start with a 1 million or 2 million project peter was stunned to hear such a low figure of a couple million but knew that in aerospace a couple million often led to many more millions he listened to them with interest but made sure not to get his hopes up still at the very least even if elon and adeo did nothing peter had met some smart guys who would be friends elon was a major trekkie he had watched all of the episodes as a kid in south africa dreamed of spaceships and read heinlein asimov and douglas adams he said his successes in silicon valley had paved the way for his future in spacenot unlike what jeff bezos had told him adeo elon and peter shared an interest in using small teams to accomplish what only the government had done before though elon remarked that he saw the government as a corporationthe biggest corporation and like peter adeo and elon didnt see nasa as the bad guy but instead saw the publics expectation of perfection as an unnecessary speed limit on innovation the expectation that everything needed to go right caused nasa to be overly cautious elon talked about how he had been trying to understand why the world had not made more progress in sending people to the moon or mars there was a lot of excitement with the apollo program and the dream of space travel elon said it was ignited and somehow that dream died or was put into stasis he said he was trying to figure out if there is anything we can do to bring back the dream of apollo maybe even a philanthropic mission peter could see that elona logician and engineer above all elseneeded to understand the physical and psychological limitations of why rockets hadnt improved since the sixties peter knew that elon and adeo were in research mode talking to a mix of major players and fringe players in the world of aerospace peter told them he thought mars was a great place to set up a future colony but the moon was economical the moon is a place where you can go to gain access to resources and you are close enough to earth that you can build on it but elon was not interested in the moon maybe we do a mini greenhouse to mars he said maybe mice to mars maybe we grow samples of food crops he said it had been obvious to him since childhood when the moon was already reached that mars is next also mars was even more mythical more unattainable the moon was 240000 miles away from earth mars was about 34 million miles away when their orbits were together on the same side of the sun but as much as 250 million miles apart when the two planets were on the opposite sides of the sun the moon was the talcum face in the night sky mars was the outofreach gem mars would take at least half a year to reach using optimal energy cost it would take a year and a half for the planets to realign and then it would take another six months to return elon said he thought such a mission sounded entirely doable earlier in may elon had attended a mars society event with jim cameron who was working on a sixepisode tv miniseries on the red planet over breakfast the next morning with mars society cofounder robert zubrin elon had pledged 100000 to the cause peter who had been in constant pitching mode for what felt like an eternity tried to sit back and listen but he kept finding himself back in the mode of selling elon and adeo asked whether a manned mission to mars was possible for less than 10 billion now the budget is edging closer to reality peter thought peter said enticingly ive got a way for you to do it for a tenth of the cost for one billion everyone leaned in you could build a oneway mission with existing russian hardware you send a few people with the goal of their living on mars for five years until a resupply or rescue mission gets there they will be the worlds first martians adeo and elon loved the idea and spent the next hour in a fastpaced discussion going over details and obstacles peter then told them that whatever they did in space they needed to first prove themselves step by step even though peter had figured out quickly that elon and adeo had no interest in funding one of his forprofit ventures he admired how these guys were willing to gamble on space and the evening offered a pleasant surprise elon loved the xprize idea i could be a supporter of that he said elon thought that the xprize could jumpstart an industry and rekindle public interest in space elon and adeo appeared keenly interested as peter talked about the spirit of st louis charles lindbergh and the teams that had signed up for the xprize peter said that the idea for his space prize came from reading about the 25000 orteig prize offered first in 1919 to the first aviator who could fly nonstop from paris to new york or new york to paris id love to meet some of the teams elon said adeo offered to join the xprize board well after midnight the men finally walked out of the restaurant and were greeted by the whiteclad valet they had plans to meet the next morning to continue the discussion as peter drove back to his apartment in santa monica he turned on his recorder and began to reflect it was strange he said how until tonight he had felt like the kid in the room now at forty he felt more like the elder statesman both adeo and elon were weeks shy of turning thirty they were just starting on space he had never been anywhere else they only have ten million to fifteen million to spend peter said as he drove they could be backers of the xprize regardless i get the feeling well be friends i really liked this guy elon he was quieter but sounded serious about space i think i planted some ideas some seeds maybe some direction tonight

politics herschel walkers senate campaign in georgia has been mired by scandal over just how many secret children he has fathered allegations of domestic violence and multiple lies about his credentials his own campaign reportedly described him as a pathological liar but the race between the former nfl star and democratic sen raphael warnock isnt over yet and walker could win it all walkers candidacy should have been a long shot after criticizing absent black fathers a racist trope it was revealed that he has three secret children he has repeatedly fumbled when discussing major policy issues including climate change since we dont control the air our good air decided to float over to chinas bad air so when china gets our good air their bad air got to move walker said earlier this month while discussing the green new deal so it moves over to our good air space then now we got we to clean that back up but poll numbers show that this race isnt over yet an aarp georgia poll from this month saw the two candidates in a close race with warnock leading walker 50 to 47 a data for progress poll also from this month had walker leading 49 to 47 and even though a june quinnipiac college poll showed walker down by double digits he was still doing well with the traditional republican base he led warnock 52 to 45 among men 62 to 35 with white voters and 52 to 45 with those 65 or older part of the appeal is his status as a football hero walker played on the university of georgia team that won the national championship in 1980 a feat the university didnt achieve again until 2021 whenever walker would make an appearance at the universitys football stadium hed receive a standing ovation that championship is what many middleaged georgians remember and love about him university of georgia football is very dominating in the state trey hood a political science professor at university of georgia told huffpost i dont want to denigrate religion but its really a quasireligion down here his popularity is really incredible he added republican political strategists agree that walkers star power is a major plus democrats are going to have a hard time in trying to demonize herschel walker like they did kelly loeffler david johnson a strategist in georgia said in may referring to a governorappointed senator who failed to win her campaign last year and the reason is in so many peoples minds in georgia hes the great uga strong youre not going to be able to tarnish that and of course in a deeply polarized country simply having the right letter next to your name will garner a decent amount of votes especially going into the midterms which historically work out in favor of the party that isnt in control of the white house georgia is a traditionally red state that went blue in 2020 but president joe bidens approval rating in the state is hovering around 30 now there are x number of people where it doesnt matter theyre just going to pull the r lever hood said in june voters at a campaign event brushed off news coverage of walkers many scandals he is a man hes doing right by his family hes doing right by the community ronel saintvil a black republican voter told the new york times to me for somebody just to bad mouth him like this i dont believe its right theyre not focusing on the issues at hand that affect the people in georgia and i think thats whats more important walker also earned some republican bona fides by defending president donald trump during the 2020 republican national convention and claiming he was not racist it hurt my soul to hear the terrible names that people call donald walker said in a speech i take that as a personal insult that people would think ive had a 37year friendship with a racist growing up in the deep south ive seen racism up close i know what it is and it isnt donald trump he said after trump lost the election he propagated a lie that the election had been rigged which culminated in an attack on the us capitol many republicans showed their loyalty to the former president by embracing his lies and conspiracy theories and walker was no exception in the weeks following the election walker called for a revote in some of the states won by biden made baseless claims about massive voter fraud and promoted conspiracy theories about voting machines we remain committed to providing you with the

statements blatant hypocrisy allegations of abuse all seem eerily familiar trumps 2016 victory and his longlasting influence in the gop is partially due to the fact that voters embraced his style of politics his status as a reality tv celebrity didnt hurt either so while walkers flaws are seen as a liability by democrats they may also be what sends him to congress

environment by remy melina livescience staff writer an annual inventory of newly discovered species lists more than 19000 half of them insects a total of 9738 insect species were first identified in 2009 the most recent year of data compilation and thats not even counting spiders the 2011 state of observed species report released jan 18 by the international institute for species exploration at arizona state university categorized 19232 species that became known to science during the 2009 calendar year as the number of species increases so too does our understanding of the biosphere said arizona state entomologist quentin wheeler a founding director of the institute the report the institutes fourth showed a 56 percent increase from the previous year in the number of newly discovered species after insects the largest group of new living species was vascular plants totaling 2184 newly discovered arachnids a group that includes spiders and mites numbered 1487 fortyone of the listed species were mammals and seven were birds there were also 1360 newly identified species of fungi and 1107 new microbes in fact the number of new living species discovered in 2009 was about twice as many as were known in the lifetime of carolus linnaeus the swedish botanist who initiated the modern system of plant and animal classification more than 250 years ago the cumulative knowledge of species since 1758 when linnaeus was alive is nearly 2 million but much remains to be done wheeler said a reasonable guess is that 10 million additional plant and animal species await discovery by scientists and amateur species explorers the report notes there is a growing need for improved approaches regarding species exploration and the recognition of new species an obvious lesson learned during the compilation of the reports data was that the registration of all the aspects that contribute to the identification and naming of a new species including its description must be mandatory going forward wheeler said in the animal world it takes about two years to mine the international literature for evidence of newly named species wheeler explained the current lack of registration requirements simply compounds the problem of an already massive backlog the researchers stressed that species discovery and identification play an important role in designing future wildlife conservation efforts it is through knowledge of the unique attributes of species that we illuminate the origin and evolutionary history of life on our planet wheeler said as we find out where species live and how they interact we increase our ability to understand the function of ecosystems and make effective factbased decisions regarding conservation in addition to the new report the species institute is releasing a retro state of observed species report which reviews species discovered from 2000 to 2009 the retro sos shows that 176311 species were discovered during that period you can follow livescience writer remy melina on twitter remymelina follow livescience for the latest in science news and discoveries on twitter livescience and on facebook 11 amazing new species discovered in 2011 gallery dazzling photos of dewcovered insects no creepy crawlies here gallery of the cutest bugs we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again copyright 2012 livescience a techmedianetwork company all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed
environment this story is about four boston terrier pups that got mange from their mother they would have been okay had they received the proper medical care unfortunately that did not happen it took weeks and the loss of one of the pups for the breeder to finally relinquish them to the local shelter too young to be adopted they would have been euthanized had the shelter not taken steps to save them and had a loving foster mom not stepped forward to care for the remaining three demodectic mange also called demodex is a skin disease caused by tiny mites most pups get a few mange mites from their moms when they are born or soon after a few mites are considered normal and are to be expected usually doing no harm it only get dangerous when an animal with a compromised immune system like newborn puppies allows the mite numbers to get out of control an overpopulation of mites and prolonged absence of medical care can cause the mange to spread leading to other potentially deadly infections demodex is not contagious and cannot be passed to humans it just looks horrible and is very uncomfortable for the animal plagued in this case four puppies were born to a mother already suffering from demodex the owner could not care for the entire family so he kept the mother and abandoned her poor sick little pups at a local shelter the pups were barely a couple weeks old and too young to even be adopted when the mange had reached a critical point their hair was falling out in clumps and their skin became scaly what started out as a few spots soon spread to the rest of their tiny fragile little bodies the pups were sick weak and in desperate need of medical care often dogs that need costly ongoing medical treatments are humanely euthanized the understaffed and underfunded shelter simply doesnt have the time or money to give many of the sick or injured animals the costly care they need instead of euthanizing these pups the shelter reached out to their community and asked for help a kind foster mom by the name of candi crawford stepped forward and took on the challenge of caring for three very sick little puppies the pups needed costly dips and skin salves for one pup the mange caused other more serious infections and the toll was too much for his tiny body he sadly passed away but within two weeks his brother and two sisters were doing much better their hair began to grow back and they had become the rambunctious little pups that they were born to be today the pups have recovered and found their forever homes lucky pup cora found a home with foster mom candi who couldnt help but fall in love with this little cutie the baldwin park animal care center in baldwin park ca always has so many beautiful animals available for adoption please reach out to them on facebook to show them your support and share the many dogs cats and bunnies that are available for adoption you can see more of their adoptable pets on petfinder baldwin park also remember no matter what breed of dog you are looking for they can be found at your local shelter or with a local rescue organization do you have a tail of hope wed love to hear it visit us at thepetcollectivetv and tell us your story visit the pet collective website for more amazing tails of hope the pet collective youtube channel thepetcollective the pet collective cares youtube channel tpccares the pet collective facebook thepetcollective

did she and jack share a shred of common ground so she made the best of it i never understood her interest in the slowest of my countrys games my life was frantically busy at 30 and 40 and baseball with its glacial tempo its pitchers and hitters forever stepping off the mound or out of the box its seventh inning stretch its men in archaic garb standing around so very much of the time apparently doing nothing was entirely too static a tableau to hold my interest baseball was the kabuki of american sports when home i would zip through the room where my mother watched riveted gently shaking my head in disbelief how could anyone sit still for three hours or mercy upon us nearly nine on april 18th 1981 the pawtucket red sox and rochester red wings two teams from the triplea international league played the longest game in professional baseball history it lasted for 33 innings with eight hours and 25 minutes of playing time what did she see in the game that i did not what was it about baseball well as my friend jean nolan is wont to say to me when i despair again about my teams prospects its a long season elizabeth just as in life in baseball you have to take or learn to take the long view the best players and the best fans and the best fans of the worst teams must graft onto their fasttwitch 21stcentury muscles sinews and neurons a very old teaching the secret of zen and the secret of baseball is just three words not always so and apologies and thanks to shunryu suzuki roshi for this will the mets lose again this year as they did last year and the year before that and the year before that well perhaps but not always so in baseball as in life one must suspend ones disbelief sometimes seemingly forever chicago cubs i feel your pain and if one is fortunate come to enjoy suspending ones disbelief like the players god bless them in inane interview after inane interview during which eventually one and all of us pray the nonnative speakers will be struck dumb before uttering the same anodyne response yet again one must win or lose with grace quit the field with as much dignity as may be mustered and tomorrow perhaps on too little sleep sometimes on no rest and too often recovering from a third tommy john surgery take the field again watch baseball you kids at home and prepare for life its long its slow there are sometimes way more losses than wins how you play is always going to be much more important than how much you win and you have to have a team and become a team player to have any success at all also if you do a dumb little victory pantomime like jenrry mejia youre going to be disciplined by your captain and come off looking like a heaven forbid american football player a fate worse than death baseball is about good manners not showboating but im getting ahead of myself perhaps youll think im putting baseball forward as a primer for life itself baseball is americas homegrown version of zen buddhism good day fine but dont get cocky lousy day fine too but do better tomorrow you win some you lose some some get rained out all fine thats about as close as i can get to expressing my respect for this absurd slow infuriating nitpicky fussilyanachronistic allmale yes thats unfortunate but the subject of another essay and i posit given mone davis this past years little league phenom things may be looking up for women in the sport violencefree well but for giancarlo stanton and pgrated form of national theater theater and religion baseball is both its where americans can go en masse to suspend their disbelief pay their respects to perseverance and grace under pressure praise the rare outliers of godliness ruth aaron mays gehrig etc and express even cubs fans hope in the face of the universal human certainties decline disappointment debacle and death as a mets fan i know my team will probably lose every blessed year on some deep level i know this and yet when spring training starts up again in las vegas binghamton and port st lucie i will just as surely know spring has returned baseball is as insidious as the monarch butterflies annual return to san juan capestrano somehow one forgets last years losses and in february or march still grim months in the greater new york area trains ones eyes on a little town southeast of orlando this year in the depths of a major depression i found it difficult always to focus on my team on the game some nights i would sit completely silent alongside my vociferous spouse as he egged on a struggling pitcher or hitter multiple hitters even the stalwart david wright enduring unending slumps at bat but about halfway through the season i latched on to a 26yearold rookie pitcher named jacob degrom whom i nicknamed baby bird kid looks a bit like an adolescent stork with a curly bell of auburn hair hes kept wellgroomed but long all season twentysix years old in the big leagues hes already been through tommy john surgery and wasnt called up to new york till may of 2014 degroms a quiet phenomenon and a favorite of announcer keith hernandez whose color commentary is almost as important as the game itself to me every year so depressed and dejected as i was throughout the long spring and summer i was brought back again and again by my husband and degrom and hernandez to the fact of the long season the fact that baseball and life are a long season of ups and downs and dead zones too and that while it might seem to me that my depression would never lift it persists still and that the mets might always lose they did again this year it is in fact not always so and on september 15th 2014 two days after my bleak 63rd birthday degrom faced the miami marlins and struck out the first eight batters he faced tying the mlb record there ensued much dancing up and down and yelling in our new jersey den here and not the last of the season i feel sure we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you

sports lets step back and do a reality check for a moment shall we we like to think we are good at that here in america we like to think we are objective unlike morally challenged uruguay from coach oscar tabarez to president jose pepe mujica to most fans of la garra morder which actually thinks that luis suarez did nothing wrong in biting an opponent for the third time here in the states we admit mistakes perhaps too much so when it comes to foreign affairs which emboldens our enemies not softens their hearts as our wellintentioned president oft forgets so heres the mea culpa about the us performance at the fifa 2014 world cup the usa was not any more impressive in this cup than in previous world cups in fact despite hosannas from various soccer newbies we actually took a step backwards against ghana we were outshot and outplayed for most of the match the selfcentered if hugely talented black stars failed to capitalize on several scoring chances maybe they were still obsessed with the size of their bonuses meanwhile our offense outside of a fantastic goal 30 seconds into the match by the indomitable clint dempsey who in true usa fashion played most of the game with a broken nose and the header of his life by one of coach klinsmanns german imports john brooks looked cautiously anemic against a depleted portugal we actually pressed forward for a change before a late game michael bradley lapse enabled a cristianoronaldoassisted tying header by substitute silvestre varela against germany we were back to playing defensive football and we lost ditto against belgium and we lost again americas overall 2014 fifa world cup record two losses one tie one win hardly a performance to set the world on fire or a validation of jurgen klinsmans fitnessfirst pedagogy so what exactly is the big takeaway here the usa desperately needed alltime usa goal and assist leader landon donovan whom klinsmann inexplicably left off the 23man usa team when striker jozy altidore went down with a strained left hamstring in the 21st minute of the ghana match the sheer boneheaded petulance of the donovan decision came home to roost on multiple occasions throughout the tournament there was stark evidence of the need for a creative playmaker like donovan to come off the bench never more so than in the blown opportunity to easily score by chris wondolowski at the end of regulation in the knockout game against belgium there was no coaching brilliance in the belgium game that put us in a lastsecond position to win it was a shoddy feckless and thus strangely unamerican show of defensive football and the score could easily have been 70 had not allworld keeper tim howard saved klinsmanns speck on a recordbreaking 16 different occasions donovan to his eternal credit has been softspoken and gracious throughout this insulting charade his behavior is commendable given that once again america in a rare area in which we feel undeserved inferiority went off and hired a highprofile foreigner to ostensibly teach us how to do it better the usa has been playing international soccer since 1885 tens of millions of americans regularly play the game especially in grade school and junior high our mens team made it to the world cup semifinals in 1930 and the quarterfinals in 2002 and they have qualified for every world cup since 1990 and our womens soccer team is widely regarded as the best in the world so were not the equivalent of the jamaican bobsled team okay and its not as if we need some foreign coach even a former soccer superstar like jurgen klinsmann to tell us how to play americans find a way to win at any game even when we dont have the top talent even when its not our national sport and especially when the chips are down and the odds are stacked against us see miracle on ice stalwarts like donovan proved that repeatedly on soccers biggest stage only a clinical yet strangely new age perpetual southern california sunshine does weird things to the otherwise levelheaded teutonic brain soccer engineer like ocbased klinsmann would deliberately overlook the obvious star quality of donovan just because of his performance in practice good sir what did you need to see in practice just look at the last three world cups to see what the redlands native can do just look at the 2010 world cup game against algeria in which a lastsecond goal by donovan propelled the us into the round of 16 leaving the la galaxy forward off the us squad is like leaving a 32yearold michael jordan off the usa mens olympic basketball team 32yearold landon donovan is the greatest most clutch scorer in us world cup history and hes won a few mls championships to boot heck allen iverson in his prime would routinely skip or walk through practice but he always turned it on come game time his american coaches understood that and gave him slack his teammates too i doubt 36yearold miroslav klose of klinsmanns own germany kept up real well against die mannschafts young bucks in practice nevertheless he made the german squad and contributed off the bench when it counted ditto for 35yearold andrea pirlo of italy klinsmanns reasoning made zero sense at the time of his shocking decision most us soccer fans were in angry disbelief when they heard about it and after the disappointing usa result definitely not now i suspect that power dynamics had to be at play and that klinsmann did not want a successful older statesman like donovan challenging his dogmatic german ways in the end its another example of blind us trust in seeming experts its like the decision to invade iraq which as any fool could tell was based on trumped up evidence and bogus rationales but most americans reasoned well these puffed up bush guys act like they know what they are doing lets give it a shot even though we knew saddam had zero to do with 911 was not harboring wmds as hans blix made obvious and was not a clear and present danger to this country such misguided trust invariably comes back to bite us in the neck luis suarez style yet here we did it again on the worlds greatest sports stage the confident jurgen klinsmann was not just wrong for leaving donovan off the team but he was doubly wrong for going against the manly spirit of this cando nation in running with a highly defensive 451 posture and in clutch games playing not to lose instead of going for the jugular thats a very safe german position from a cautious german coach who had low expectations for the potential of us soccer players and who obviously in his dna still does not grasp the killer instinct at the heart of the american zeitgeist a true american coach would have gone for it as we did when we beat topranked spain in the semifinals and when we almost beat brazil in the finals of the confederations cup back in 2009 moreover having donovan in the locker room would have made sure that the uniquely yankee drive to win at all costs was instilled and rewarded instead we fulfilled our narrow german coachs limited expectations who got what he wanted a country singing his praises when nothing empirically changed at all in the us world cup result now that this country has finally woken to the significance and beauty of the world cup when status quo sports stars like kobe bryant are tweeting about it you know its gone mainstream lets do what we do in every other sport in which a team does not measure up to its potential lets fire the underwhelming german mastermind and bring in a proven winner with the necessary grace wisdom and chutzpah to guide the usa to victory in russia that person would be none other than landon donovan

social while were at it maybe we should just design classrooms without windows and hey ill bet kids would really perform better if they spent their days in isolation my friend was reacting facetiously of course to a new study that found that kindergarteners scored better on a test of recall if their classrooms walls were completely bare a room filled with posters maps and the kids own art constituted a distraction the study published last month in psychological science and picked up by science world report the boston globe and other media outlets looked at a whopping total of 24 children a research assistant read to them about a topic such as plate tectonics or insects then administered a paperandpencil test to see how many facts they remembered on average kids in the decorated rooms were off task 39 percent of the time and had a learning score of 42 percent the respective numbers for those in the bare rooms were 28 percent and 55 percent now if you regularly read education studies you wont be surprised to learn that the authors of this one never questioned or even bothered to defend the value of the science lessons they used whether they were developmentally appropriate or presented effectively whether they involved anything more than reading a list of facts or were likely to hold any interest for 5yearolds nor did the researchers vouch for the quality of the assessment whatever raises kids scores on any test and of any material was simply assumed to be a good thing and anything that lowers scores is bad hence the authors concern that children tend to be distracted by the visual environment translation they may attend to something in the room other than the facts that an adult has decided to transmit to them and hence my friends wry reductio ad absurdum response alas sparse classrooms had their own problems there were told children were more likely to be distracted by themselves or by peers even if we strip everything off the walls those pesky kids will still engage in instructionally useless behaviors like interacting with one another or thinking about things that interest them the researchers referred to the latter thinking as being distracted by themselves mark that phrase as the latest illustration of the principle that in the field of education satire has become obsolete our attention seems to be fixed relentlessly on the means by which to get students to accomplish something we remain undistracted by anything to do with ends what it is theyre supposed to accomplish and whether its really valuable perhaps thats why schools of education typically require methods classes but not goals classes in the latter students might be invited to read this study and ask whether a child could reasonably regard the lesson as a distraction from her desire to think talk or look at a cool drawing on the wall other students might object on the grounds that its a teachers job to decide what students ought to do and to maximize their time on task but such conversations time on what task why is it being taught who gets to decide are shut down before they begin when all we talk about in education schools in journals in professional development sessions is how to maximize time on whatever is assigned those of us who are disturbed even outraged by whats being done to our schools in the name of reform imposing rampedup uniform prescriptive standards highstakes testing and pressure thats both vertical with kindergartens now resembling really bad firstgrade classrooms and horizontal with little time for music and the arts recess studentdesigned projects or any subjects not being tested ought to consider how this agenda is quietly supported by research that relies on test scores as the primary or even the sole dependent variable then too theres the way such research is described by journalists most articles in education week for example ought to include this caveat please keep in mind that phrases such as effective policies higher achievement better results or improved outcomes refer only to scores on standardized tests these tests are not only poor indicators of meaningful intellectual accomplishment but tend to measure the socioeconomic status of the students or the amount of time they have been trained in testtaking skills the idea that kindergarteners ought to block everything out but facts about plate tectonics reminded me of an essay called can teachers increase students selfcontrol as usual the question was can not should written by a cognitive psychologist named daniel willingham he offered as a role model a hypothetical child who looks through his classroom window and sees construction workers pouring cement for a sidewalk but manages to ignore this interesting scene and focus on his work but what was the work was it a fillintheblank wasteofthetime that would lead any child to look out the window or at the wall or was it something so intellectually valuable that wed be justified in saying hey this really is worth it i dont know but for willingham as for so many others it apparently doesnt matter if the teacher assigned it thats reason enough to ignore the interesting reallife lesson in how a sidewalk is created to refrain from asking the teacher why that lesson cant be incorporated into the curriculum an exemplary student is one who stifles his curiosity exercises his selfcontrol and does what hes told is a given lesson worth teaching i may not always be sure of the answer but im pretty sure thats the question we should be asking rather than employing discipline or demanding selfdiscipline or pulling stuff off the walls in hopes that students will devote their attention to something whose value is simply taken for granted we remain

article called teaching strategies that work just dont ask work to do what which focused on a research review challenging the effectiveness of discoverybased learning without ever asking what constitutes effectiveness there too my point was that if we dont ask what were looking for and argue about the values that underlie our answers well end up by default with a goal like higher test scores or in the case of classroom management strategies compliance 2 i offered this example in my book the myth of the spoiled child da capo press 2014 and in the same chapter cited a pair of studies by angela duckworth and her colleagues that found that an elite group of middle schoolers performed better in the national spelling bee if they were higher in grit whereas spellers higher in openness to experience defined as preferring using their imagination playing with ideas and otherwise enjoying a complex mental life performed worse the study also found that the most effective preparation strategy was solitary deliberate practice activities rather than say reading books thus if enjoying a complex mental life or reading for pleasure interferes with performance in a oneshot contest to see who can spell more obscure words correctly and if sufficient grittiness to spend time alone memorizing lists of words helps to achieve that goal this is regarded as an argument in favor of grit but of course the unasked question once again concerns ends rather than means how important is it that kids who are exceptionally good spellers win more championships should we favor any strategy or personality feature that contributes to that objective or to anything that could be described as higher achievement regardless of what it involves and what it displaces

entertainment i dont think our friends alberto and jerry knew it was jackies birthday when they presented us with the best gift a special chicken it was special in a couple of ways for one thing it had been raised carefully on a small farm near their place in pennsylvania kreeky tree farm for another it was of a breed that ive never run into in new york at a butcher shop or a farmers market stand closely related to the highlyregarded bresse chickens raised in france with their characteristic blueblack legs our chickens legs had been left on to signal its heritage such a promising chicken deserved to be cooked simply maybe roasted or poached in stock with a creamy sauce made from the poaching liquid or aha maybe potroasted potroasting is an underappreciated method for a whole chicken but it has the appeal of regular roasting it yields a goldenskinned object to be presented before carving if you like that kind of theater with a few advantages on the cooking side once it is under way it requires little attention and timing is somewhat flexible you could say the same of roasting but few cooks can resist poking and monitoring even if they profess a minimalist justthrowitintheoven philosophy true you dont get crackling skin but after proper resting 20 or 30 minutes even the crunchiestskinned roast chicken will lose its crispness unless you fry it or torch it and on the plate you get particularly flavorful flesh with thoroughly cooked dark meat and unless you go out for a fivemile run and forget to retrieve the pot from the oven breast meat that remains sufficiently moist though it will never be as perfect as when the breast is cooked separately and attentively moreover even though mostly cooked in a covered pan it does not taste braised or stewed or steamed it tastes very much like roast chicken pot roasting is not complicated though it begins with two extra steps heres how i do it i start an hour or a day ahead by seasoning the chicken generously with salt and pepper and cramming the cavity with mixed fresh herbs more or less whatever youve got around try to include thyme or rosemary other than that youre on your own i then truss the chicken not for the sake of socalled even cooking but for ease of handling and for good looks there are dozens of ways to do this some using a big needle and some just string i have no favorite method look at books or online videos and take your pick so long as you end up with a compact football of chicken whose extremities do not flop around when you manipulate the chicken heat the oven to a little higher than 350 f say 180 c in a heavy casserole preferably oval rather than round and big enough to hold the chicken snugly i use staub or le creuset enameled cast iron lightly brown the chicken in a little butter or oil do this over mediumlow heat and give it four or five minutes on each side if there are places that do not get browned dont worry about it but ensure that the sides drumsticks thighs and wings and the foreend of the breast take on some color meanwhile slice an onion or leek and a carrot or two and fetch a big clove of garlic leave it whole skin on or off when the chicken is golden remove it to a plate and put the vegetables into the casserole along with any poultry trimmings wing tips wishbone skin scraps and in this case feet brown them lightly add butter for flavor and herbs some or all of the ones inside the chicken then douse with half a cup 120 ml white wine turn up the heat and boil it down until it no longer tastes or smells raw now add liquid stock is ideal but water will do to just submerge the vegetables and set the chicken on this base adding any juices or fat that have accumulated on the plate its been resting on cover the casserole and put it in the oven an hour later a little longer for a chicken much bigger than 312 pounds 16 kg remove the lid make sure the liquid hasnt disappeared this is unlikely and return the casserole to the oven uncovered for another 20 or 25 minutes that should do it grab one of the legs if the thigh joint has loosened and wiggles easily even though trussed in place youre okay it is that onehour covered cooking time thats a little flexible you wouldnt want to cook it much less than an hour but if you left it in the oven for an hour and a quarter during that phase the chicken would not dry out move the chicken which will be browner than it was when you first browned it onto a plate lay a piece of foil over it the foil is optional and leave it alone for anywhere between 15 and 45 minutes put the casserole over mediumhigh heat add stock or water if thats all youve got in which case consider adding a tablespoon of good soy sauce and boil until the sauce is delicious and because in this kind of cooking the chicken contributes a great deal to the juices it will be delicious strain out the vegetables and scraps pressing lightly to get as much goodness out of them as possible let the fat rise to the surface and get rid of as much of it as you like simmer the sauce checking for seasoning and if you like finishing with some chopped herbs but not a lot carve and serve the delicious birthdaypresent chicken was served with corn fritters a few nights later an excellent freerange chicken from a good butcher was cooked in the same way and was eaten with minty eggplant like the one i wrote about a while ago but without the dates make soup or stock from the carcass make coronation chicken or patties call them rissoles or kotlety or croquettes if you like with any leftover meat this could become your favorite way of roasting chicken our beautiful present blueblack feet and all trussed seasoned and ready to be cooked on a good day aim for this kind of initial browning in the same pan aromatics chicken trimmings including those beautiful feet and butter the browned chicken set over the aromatics wine and stock we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased

social dr vitti incoming superintendent of detroit schools there are more than 130 charter schools in detroit in 2013 the district put 79 abandoned schools up for sale today more detroit students attend charter schools than traditional public ones developments that played a significant role in the rise of us education secretary betsy devos to most the charter phenomenon in detroit helped dig what was already a big hole for public schools suffering through unpreceded population and funding losses in 1966 nearly 300000 students went to city public schools today its fewer than 45000 down from 90000 in the past seven years alone the time in which area charter schools have flourished but the growth of largely unregulated charter school competition and the collapsing student population is just one challenge and detroit schools have plenty according to the national assessment of educational progress which measures academic achievement in american schools only 5 percent of detroit fourthgraders were proficient in math in 2015 which was actually an increase from 2013 which was actually an increase from 2011 but after a controversial takeover of the district by state managers a new round of intervention and 617 million in funding by state lawmakers the district may be on a new path thats the hope of dr nikolai vitti and the detroit school board who in their first major decision as a board hired him to be detroits new superintendent his contract was approved friday right now dr vitti is the superintendent of duval county florida jacksonville and a native of detroit dearborn heights and while detroits job is definitely more visible and comes with more challenges and sleepless nights its not at least by the numbers a step up the duval county public schools system is the 22nd largest in the nation with about 124000 students if you count only the students in noncharter schools detroits shrinking base of 45000 students would not place among the top 100 largest districts even so dr vitti is in a fighting mood about public school competition and is eager to discuss his track record of success in jacksonville and in places such as miamidade one of the largest most diverse districts in the country talking to dr vitti about his tenure in jacksonville is like asking a concert pianist about why they love music while theyre late for a concert you can sense his passion and his mastery of the subject even at a pace that comes from not wanting to miss any detail or be even a second late for his next challenge hes proud to rattle off the numbers you can tell he knows by heart with what you can sense is an eye on detroit he says theres a lot to be proud of narrowing the achievement gap in low performing schools is a big one in fourth and eighth grade math and reading jacksonville is now among the top four urban districts in threequarters of the measured areas he said were in the top four with africanamerican students and in the top two with hispanic students in those metrics when compared with similar districts dr vitti said we went from fifth in africanamerican graduation rates to first and we have the narrowest gap in reading between black and white students in all districts the narrowest gap in algebra too he said although he did not make the comparison its easy to see on the national assessment of educational progress in which just 5 percent of detroit fourthgraders were proficient in math 41 percent in jacksonville were placing it above the national average for large urban districts there are many more numbers from dr vittis tenure in jacksonville that point to improvement far too many to list and while the numbers in jacksonville tell the what they dont tell the how when i asked him how he did it and what that means for his future in detroit he said the story of jacksonvilles improvement could be found in three areas instruction human investment and attention to the whole child here then inferring from what he did in jacksonville is what may be on the educational horizon for one of the countrys most analyzed more paralyzed districts our inputs have changed to create better outputs dr vitti said the core is instruction be an educator something dr vitti was he taught at the high school and middle school levels in north carolina and new york city according to his official bio i find it ironic that everyone talks about improving education and no one talks about improving instruction yet they wonder why student achievement doesnt improve he said in jacksonville dr vitti and his team redrew the curriculum and designed accountability and support measurers for teachers so many people dont get that right he said you think you can just do accountability but for every degree of accountability there has to be an equal degree of support we were very explicit about the need for strong leadership in our schools dr vitti told me in the beginning he said there were a significant number of principal changes too many schools had principals who were there to long and we were trying to get skills sets and will sets connected to challenges and opportunities in specific schools he said it was a rocky start as many left or accepted new positions at new institutions but we trained our leaders on instructional leadership and evaluated to that how to give feedback how to do professional development he said duval initiated a twice a year cutting edge instructional culture survey by tntp the new teacher project to bring focus to reasons why teachers stayed in or left the profession information school leaders used to drive better teacher training and support with that the district invested heavily in elevating existing teaching talent putting the best people in the places where they could do the most good and recruiting new teachers especially those who fit with dr vittis strong emphasis on the whole child more on that in a moment organizations that improve invest in their people the superintendent said and we had to be proactive about building a teaching pipeline because fewer and fewer of the best and brightest are going into teaching we had to ask questions like how do we incentivize the best to go into teaching and stay as teachers we offered 20000 above what they made to get our best teachers to stay in or relocate to specific schools he said now 75 of those schools are graded by the state as c or higher or improved at least one letter grade and not one an f any longer we also said to our teachers well pay for your masters degree if you give us three years in our schools dr vitti said its all part of growing the pipeline so we keep our best teachers and can bring in new ones in what was the only thing he specifically said can be transported to detroit dr vitti highlighted his districts focus on the whole child working on issues such as alternative discipline and mental health while keeping high stakes accountability measures in perspective as we shifted to start measuring how kids were performing maybe that pendulum swung too far and we started to ignore art athletics and ignored how to engage kids in a positive way he said we became reactive punitive we forget we were kids we made mistakes too the district again brought in technology this time hero k12 which enables districts schools and teachers to consistently reinforce and track desired student behaviors such as good citizenship or punctuality with it he said schools create a culture to incentivize students to do the right thing because you move behavior more by accentuating the positive and some people have seen the difference what dr vittis whole child approach has done in duval is remarkable said robert alonso director of business development at hero k12 by putting emphasis and attention on the positive the culture and atmosphere in some of these schools has completely changed i have seen firsthand the changes making them a better place to teach and learn and work than they were he said under dr vitti jacksonville schools also invested in mental health bringing resources to schools so parents dont have to navigate the red tape for mental health services all our employees are trained in mental health detection he said he did that he said because unrecognized and untreated mental health issues can manifest in negative behavior and negative interactions with their peers according to dr vitti out of school suspensions in duval are down by more than a third since his programs started given the climate of charters and choice in detroit dr vittis words and attitudes on competition are likely to stir passions youve got to embrace competition embrace choice and own that landscape and not be intimidated or reactive he said its essential he said to embrace the opportunity to compete with private and charter offer an experience thats better when public education gets it right they get it really right better than our competitors he said for example new orleans he said has been defined as a place of transformation a place where charters work what i want detroit to be is the mecca of transformation through traditional education a place where everyone will eventually go to be part of the work a place reformers will really flock to those are strong words its understandable to be skeptical the question on the minds of detroit parents teachers students and stakeholders and education observers nationally is simple can dr vitti transport his jacksonville accomplishments and reforms to detroit that probably depends on whether you think detroit schools can find success at all if you do its difficult to question dr vittis passion or his successes or overlook that those closest to his schools see his achievements too the headline in jacksonvilles newspaper as news of his detroit offer spread was nikolai vitti did what hired to do make changes in jacksonvilles schools if any place is in need of change its detroit as i asked him if he was ready for the spotlight and the challenges that await him there he was characteristically not shy once youve been through the rodeo you learn how the bull kicks you off ill be even better at this rodeo he said we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like

health in july of 2017 the fda announced that americas opioid addiction was their biggest crisis on hand an alarming jump in opioidrelated deaths up to over 59000 in 2016 alone is gripping the nations attention with lawmakers and government officials wondering what can be done to put a dent in this growing epidemic and while much of the attention is going to the addicts themselves theres another side of the story that needs to be told about the children of the epidemic very few people havent seen the viral videos of children being around their parents while they use from the children looking on from the backseat of the car to the heartbreaking videos of young kids trying to wake their overdosed parents up the children of these addicts are silent victims whether taken out of their parents custody officially or given to relatives or grandparents to raise these children are forced to face the realities of life too soon having to grow up quickly is one thing but these kids are being dealt cards that are setting them up for a much greater chance of failure in life according to chris chmielewski the editor of the magazine foster focus ultimately this epidemic creates an entirely new generation of foster youth if past numbers are any indicator those children are at a greater risk of becoming the next generation of opiate abusers a vicious cycle and this cycle is something the nation needs to not only be aware of but also actively working to change in the united states alone it is estimated that nearly half a million children will pass through the foster care system on any given day with the average child spending two years in the system with many spending several years this system has been taxed for years the epidemic is overwhelming many families and child welfare systems said jaia peterson lent of generations united a washingtonbased advocacy group cofounded by aarp at a special committee on aging hearing last march suddenly grandparents are forced to navigate complex systems to help meet the challenges of the children who come into their care often after experiencing significant trauma because of the opiate crisis more children are entering the foster care system this year their parents taken into custody deemed unfit as parents and while parents can earn their rights back many are legally terminated leaving their children permanently in the foster care system until they are adopted or until they have aged out at eighteen on average it costs anywhere from 20000 to 30000 each year to pay for one child in the foster care system the government spends over 9 billion annually to run the nations foster care system as the opiate crisis takes more children away from parents these numbers will only increase while there need to be legal repercussions for those abusing opioids in our nation putting them into the traditional system has proven again and again to be ineffective when individuals with serious addictions are jailed without receiving proper care and treatment they are likely to fall back into their habits when released with statistics showing that they are more likely to overdose after incarceration as well many communities are developing family treatment drug courts ftdcs alternatively known as dependency drug courts ftdcs are an increasingly popular method of a meeting the requirements of asfa and b enhancing the functional status and reunification success among families involved in child welfare and affected by substance use disorders after the nations cocaine epidemic three decades ago drug courts began to pop up putting addicts into a system that wasnt just about incarceration instead drug courts are designed to help addicts recover giving them a better shot at a healthy life we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again by implementing more drug courts around the nation the united states can contribute to reducing the risk of convicted addicts becoming repeat offenders and increase the chance of reuniting families
entertainment 1 if you post your glutenfree menu on your website its more likely i and people like me will come to your restaurant so many restaurants offer separate gf menus but dont post them online how do i know you offer this if you dont post it i always evaluate menus online before i go anywhere if you have a gf menu youre 90 of the way to me booking a table 2 if you offer a variety of glutenfree options on your menu please offer something other than creme brulee ice cream and flourless chocolate cake for dessert if you dont want to make glutenfree desserts there are so many wonderful bakeries that do ive been to so many restaurants where there are wonderful appetizer and entree options but the same tired three nothought desserts i dont want to eat any of these ever again a restaurant that offers real desserts would see my family returning again and again i understand if you cant make these yourself but there now wonderful glutenfree bakeries in almost all cities where you could buy pastries many restaurants outsource dessert why not do the same for glutenfree options 3 please understand that a true glutenfree friendly restaurant does more than just take gluten off the plate im so tired of having my entree options include fish with no sauce or steak with no sauce or chicken without the couscous please make real substitutions instead of just subtracting things from my plate and still charging me the same amount creating a glutenfree pan sauce or flavored butter is not hard glutenfree pasta is readily available as are glutenfree rolls and bread cornstarch thickens glutenfree breadcrumbs exist 4 pay attention to the dietary restrictions of your guests if i order the cioppino with rice noodles and my server knows i am glutenfree and is hopefully communicating that to the kitchen please do not put a piece of toasted wheat bread on top of my dish this happens again and again to my family 5 if you go to the trouble of creating a glutenfree menu or marking items on your menu that are gf please inform your servers about whether your specials contain gluten when you inform them about the dish i find that they almost never know about gluten even if there is a dedicated glutenfree menu for regular items and always have to go ask it doesnt inspire confidence and it creates so much back and forth to get an answers 6 earn big points with a bread alternative if you provide bread to your guests you will thrill me to no end by offering me a small plate of raw veggies pickles or corn tortilla chips instead and yes im happy to pay a small upcharge for this courtesy 7 make sure your glutenfree items really are glutenfree i have caught numerous red flags on the menus in many restaurants malt vinegar beer soy sauce or other glutencontaining ingredients listed on a dish that is supposed to be glutenfree 8 if you dont have a glutenfree menu at least make sure your servers have a list of the items on the menu that are glutenfree or at the very least that your kitchen has such a list i cant make a good decision about what to eat if the server is going back and forth to the kitchen with questions and then coming to my table trying to remember exactly what the kitchen said often much is lost in translation and a server tells us he thinks something is glutenfree 9 be respectful of the promise you are making with glutenfree food if you cant protect from crosscontamination be honest people who order glutenfree items have a variety of needs including celiacs who become seriously ill from small crosscontamination gluten intolerants who dont need a separate area in the kitchen but cant eat food you cook on the same pizza stone or in the same uncleaned pan where gluten was cooked to people who choose to avoid gluten because they dont want to eat it and are not impacted by crosscontamination at all 100 glutenfree is very hard to achieve we get it so just tell us the truth make it clear exactly what level of glutenfree youre

join us once again 10 expand your clientele by realizing that there really is no reason to use gluten in nearly every dish on your menu ive been stunned when restaurants tell me there is gluten in items such as risotto or hollandaise sauce that do not traditionally include or use gluten there are so many alternatives to gluten that work perfectly well in so many dishes i ate at a major chain hotels restaurant in dublin and they told me they use no gluten in any sauces since so many diners are celiac or intolerant there and they achieve the same results with cornstarch often people are turned off at the thought of glutenfree food but the truth is gluten is unnecessary in so many recipes and no one cares or knows if you use cornstarch instead of flour i cook wonderful food at home without gluten every single day and there is almost nothing i cant make i would love it if the professionals would come to the same conclusion

health nope this is not a mistake you are seeing these photos labelled correctly stunned yes the before photo is what you would typically see as an after photo so whats the real difference between the before and after photos and why am i posting this besides the obvious physique changes the real difference is what you cant physically see just from looking at the photos which is that im a lot more comfortable in my own skin and body in the after photo ie today my intention of posting these photos is to inspire those of you who struggle with your body image andor weight to honor and relax into the beautiful body you have now regardless of your bodys shape and size im not going to lie having an amazingly sculpted bikini fitness physique is pretty awesome you get compliments admiration you can fit into clothes easily its a great way to developenhance attributes of commitment and dedication and you witness how food can transform your physique you inspire others along the way and you learn a lot about yourself and pushing your limits physically and mentally as there are many positive aspects to having a bikini body it can equally come with a lot of costs undesirable thoughts feelings and behaviors especially if the positive attributes become extreme heres a timeline of my changing body throughout the past four and a half years after chronic dieting over the past years in 2008 i pushed my to another level by entering a figure bodybuilding competition although i was able to maintain my dream physique it came with such a price a price of constant underlying anxiety in my relationship with food i was constantly focused on food what i could and couldnt eat how would that food affect my physique being hungry and having to wait until my next meal time to eat oh no i ate chocolate i have to work out harder tomorrow and a constant focus on my bodys appearance do i look bloated is my stomach poking out too much in these pants and going to events was a challenge but i found a way to accommodate my anxiety by packing my own food in a cooler to bring to parties yes i did that or only sticking to plain ole boring veggies as much as i do really love veggies when theres a wonderful and beautiful selection of other kinds of foods my body would create tension buildup from resisting them the most painful part of being in this pattern was developing an unhealthy relationship with food which i never had any struggles with growing up ever since i discovered dieting in my early adulthood i developed periodic binging experiences although i would still binge mostly on healthy foods natural peanut butter nuts dark chocolate were usually inhaled i was in stuck in a stressful relationship with food i became afraid of eating certain foods for fear of gaining fat i had a lovehate relationship with food yikes i obtained my 2010 physique with a more balanced lifestyle less anxiety around food and being more gentle with myself however that little voice saying control yourself still came up sometimes in early 2011 i went to my first naturopath appointment to get my hormones balanced so that we could start a family i learned so much more about a true holistic health approach to the body from within i truly developed a deeper understanding about how beautiful and amazing our bodies really are more than just surface appearance i enjoyed my pregnancy and all my worries and anxieties around food disappeared because my focus was now optimal health for mommy and baby i ate whatever i felt like most of my choices were still what society would consider healthy but i definitely discovered unlimited carbs bread and cheese i was blessed with an uneventful pregnancy and worked out at the gym of course at a significantly less intense level i gained about 55lbs and was absolutely fine with this what use to be my most selfconscious part of me i grew to loved and embraced as it grew bigger and bigger post pregnancy i was on a mission to lose the babyweight and get back to my prebaby weight i joined a gym weight loss challenge and was able to get back down to my target weight by the time my son was about six or seven months however i realize that emotionally i have shifted so much in how i view my body yes i still have moments of selfconsciousness but as i continue to embrace and love my new body and appreciate how amazing it is i made a baby with it my body nourishes my healthy and happy son and its still as athletically fit as ever even if im not the most fit looking i am now truly in a loving healthy and empowered relationship with food i am no longer controlled by or fear food and i no longer fear gaining weight theres this notion in our society about having to be back at your prebaby body weight and size but i now realize that this is just another way that society is resistant to change and very dishonoring of the fact that our bodies change who says we have to go back to our prebaby weight wow that was a big aha moment for me i feel like ive not only deepened my relationship with food but also my relationship with myself and with my life and although it did take a while to get here i do not regret anything about my journey i am so glad i went through what i went through each obstaclechallenge brought me here and there was a bigger lesson in all this that in the big scheme of things what really matters is not having a perfectideal body but that when i am happy in my relationship with food with self with life i am able to feel at peace and share my own gifts with others from a deeper level we remain

health we all suffer my teacher says his voice coming from behind me circling around the back of the room we come here to remember that we are not alone in our struggles and i look down at my green yoga mat wedged in a mosaic of rubber spread out in all four directions only a couple inches of hardwood visible between at the top of our sun salutation pete stops us and with our hands at our heart we remember robin williams just like big bird and mc hammer you could say i also grew up with this overthetop far out amazinglyeccentric actor memories of williams dressed up in wigs and masks and flubber to become an english nanny or just his head orbiting baron munchausens world and later as the wise therapist telling a young will hunting youll have bad times but itll always wake you up to the good stuff you werent paying attention to these are scenes that colored my childhood taught me the power of creativity dared me to live outside the box robin williams struggles with depression were also no secret not to me nor to the world but for me they were personal and they were forgiven even celebrated with a great deal of bipolar disorder in my immediate family ive watched depressions dark tentacles wrap themselves around our hearts in the most insipid and lifealtering ways ive seen and felt the shame of mental illness as it rises up to challenge the american creed of ones right to the pursuit of happiness williams largerthanlife character creativity and especially his sadness provided a shelter a space in society for the wildness to come out and his suicide has shocked and saddened so many of us especially here in san francisco though you wont find too many facebook status updates about it the world health organization now cites suicide from depression as the thirdleading cause of death worldwide for ages 1544 male and female it is the secondleading cause of death tor teens and young adults aged 1024 by 2020 the global suicide rate is expected to double from one death every 40 seconds to one lost life every 20 meanwhile the availability and adoption of antidepressant medication grows in her book yoga for depression author and yogi amy weintraub writes currently scientists estimate that our collective knowledge doubles every 18 months but with that increased information has come a loss of connection a loss of meaning a loss of transcendence the kind so easily achieved in ancient and indigenous cultures we are suffering in epidemic proportions as individuals as a community and as a culture we may have more information but we have lost the truth of who we really are the knowledge that at the core of our beings we are not separate from others and from the universe here in the studio it is hot and sweaty now and although we first introduced ourselves i have long since forgotten my neighbors names or what i was stressed out about before i came after three rounds of sun salutations my mat is slippery my heart is sounding and my head is clear my breath flowing in and out in concert with all 60someodd people in this class has absolved me my teacher has this card he gives out that says this coupon entitles the bearer to one free hug its a joke mostly as its nearly impossible to leave the studio without getting a hug after practicing for a year and making new friends i often get more hugs in this class than i do the whole rest of the week the community even when i dont know anyone else in the room is what gets me out of my house and to the studio especially on those days when im feeling isolated and alone in my life ive encountered some people who understand this and others who do not sometimes they surprise you one of the latter a professor in a renowned design program that birthed such social tech phenomenons as the checkin app foursquare once stopped me as i ran through the hall with my yoga mat and asked why go to a class when you can do it at home and indeed in that program i learned how to humanize technology programming sensors to make patches of grass play music and sacrificing much sleep in front of a computer screen to achieve other feats of networked interaction all of which however magicalseeming in the end never gave me hugs or quieted the unrest deep inside me and at the other end there is amma this living indian guru has dedicated her life to giving hugs fierce silent and by many accounts lifechanging ones this woman whose name means mother connects with strangers who line up into the night for a brief respite in her arms peoples stories lifelong struggles and suffering being cured in the warmth of this womans embrace are remarkable and consistent when i told my 100yearold grandmother about amma she simply nodded and said forgiveness the yogis have a word for our unified consciousness they call it atman only when we are under the impression of our separation or disconnection do we suffer as albert einstein once said our task must be to free ourselves from this self imposed prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature and its beauty and i wonder about this selfimposed prison this suffering i watch it as facebook status updates replace facetoface updates as voicetotext technology keeps coming and siri becomes our closest confidante and now i think about the ways we suffer so often in secret as we grieve robin williams but my thoughts are interrupted two arms are opening in front of me beckoning me in and there is no stopping the smile that spreads across my face as i accept my teachers free hug i think of amma somewhere out there her arms also open and remember her words we expect too much from people she says we expect them to be with us forever need help in the us call 18002738255 for the national suicide prevention lifeline she practices yoga with pete guinosso in the san francisco bay area and studies with fu schroeder at green gulch farm and zen center

environment climate change may or may not have helped generate the noreaster lashing the east coast this weekend such storms happen with some regularity after all but the amount of snow the storm called nemo ultimately dumps and the extent of flood damage it leaves in its wake may well have ties to global warming climate scientists suggested michael mann a climatologist who directs the earth system science center at pennsylvania state university compared a major storm like nemo or hurricane irene or superstorm sandy for that matter to a basketball slamdunk with a lower net if you take the basketball court and raise it a foot youre going to see more slamdunks mann said not every dunk is due to raising the floor but youll start seeing them happen more often then they ought to the two key ingredients in a big snow just coldenough temperatures and a lot of moisture combine the chilled air converging on the east with the massive moisture coming from the gulf of mexico region and youve got the perfect setup for a big storm kevin trenberth of the climate analysis section at the national center for atmospheric research in colorado told the huffington post in an email as trenberth explained the ideal temperature for a blizzard is just below freezing just cold enough to crystalize water into snow below that the atmospheres ability to hold moisture to create those snowflakes drops by 4 percent for every one degree fahrenheit fall in temperature in the past temperatures at this time of year would have been a lot below freezing trenberth said in other words its been too cold to snow heavily but that may become less of an obstacle for snow in the northeast in addition to warming the air climate change is adding moisture to it sea surface temperatures are about two degrees fahrenheit warmer than they were before 1980 raising the potential for a big snow by about 10 percent according to trenberth and any individual storm including this noreaster will pick up more moisture as it spins across a warmer ocean whats more as mann explained a warm ocean clashes with cold air masses from the arctic a bigger contrast in temperatures may mean a bigger storm he said michael oppenheimer a climate change expert at princeton university said global warming is increasing extreme storms storms like this tend to be heavier than they used to be he told huffpost thats a fact as huffpost reported on friday national oceanic and atmospheric administration records show that the northeast saw a 74 percent increase in precipitation during the heaviest rain and snow events from 1958 to 2011 still connecting any specific weather event to global warming remains inexact a new area of study called event attribution science is mining data in an attempt to make more definitive links or at least better gauge the odds of an extreme event in the context of climate change that results partly from human activities including burning fossil fuels but the field is young in fact jeff masters a climatologist and founder of weather underground noted that the number of intense noreasters hasnt increased over the last three or four decades a warmer climate he explained can decrease the length of the snowy season and therefore the time window for noreasters further noreasters are defined not only by heavy snowfall but by high winds theres less evidence for links between winter winds and climate change warm weather storms such as hurricane irene and superstorm sandy are another story since hurricanes are heat engines they drive power from ocean waters said masters another climatelinked ingredient could propel this weekends storm into the history books rising sea levels we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again a threefoot storm surge on top of a higher sea level will do more damage masters said noting that sea levels in boston expected to bear the brunt of the noreaster with an historic storm surge have risen a foot in the last 90 years penn states mann also likes to use baseball metaphors when describing climates influence on major storms home runs he calls them what were seeing now with climate change is weather on steroids correction an earlier version of this story misidentified kevin trenberths job title the error has been corrected

politics for some its hearing air raid sirens while talking with relatives back in ukraine for others its the fear that ukraine may become an economic basket case even if it wins the war or that the world may forget the countrys plight altogether ukrainans their friends and those simply curious about the country thats fought russia to standstill gathered on a sunsplashed weekend at st andrew ukrainian orthodox cathedral in suburban washington for the regions biggest annual ukrainian cultural festival amid women wearing garlands in their hair men wearing vyshyvanka white shirts with intricately patterned embroidery down the front and accompanied by traditional and pop ukrainian music the war was never far from peoples minds what in past years had been a chance to showcase the culture and drink some beers from the home country had taken on a different somewhat deeper meaning this year is particularly beautiful and sad at the same time said the church pastor the rev volodymr steliac as he formally opened the festival saturday we have seen the worst of humanity but at the same time we have seen the best of humanity the festival opened on day 206 of the invasion and came amid good news for ukraine a surprise counteroffensive in the northeast that in a few days cleared russians from towns and villages they had fought weeks to take earlier in the war but the victory came with a price in the strategic town of izium mass graves were found similar to those seen in the capital kyivs suburb of bucha when the war began we have seen the worst of humanity but at the same time we have seen the best of humanity oksana sukhina who was staffing the booth of the us ukraine foundation where she is project director said she wanted to see what the impact of the latest reports of atrocities will be on europe in the past she said some people suspected ukrainians have exaggerated the cruelty of the russians with reports of horrific claims like rape as a weapon of war and the theft of household goods then shipped to russia then you see bucha you see now izyum and we have yet to see kherson and mariupol and other places sukhina said sukhina 50 immigrated to the us from kyiv in 2020 warned by former colleagues in the state department about the likelihood of invasion her parents arrived in washington only days before the war but as the prospect of kyivs being captured receded they went back as did one of her daughters they joined a 23yearold son who left his it job in chicago in march to help deliver food and medical supplies in kyiv sukhina said she tried to convince him to stay but could not forbid him to leave because she had participated in prodemocracy protests in 2004 and 2014 im proud of them they are trying to do whatever they can and this is what makes us win she said steliac said the church was open 247 when the war began he was only getting two or three hours of sleep a night as volunteers dropped off humanitarian aid organized it and shipped it to ukraine in one 48hour period he said two of those young volunteers lost their fathers back in ukraine the war is not there alone the war is here as well steliac said even though the process of gathering and sending aid has become more routine even keeping in touch with family back home he said can be painful what was traumatic was that they were communicating with their relatives and they said oh a bomb fell just a couple of neighborhoods over and then they tried to connect again and the phone connection doesnt go through steliac said alex naumovych a 36year old mortgage loan officer from ternopil in the western part of ukraine said hes had calls interrupted by the air raid sirens although now he said the alarms are likely to be ignored ternopil a city of about 250000 has no military targets but he said his parents still hear the sirens daily ukraine tracks incoming missiles and activates local warning systems based on where they could potentially land so even residents of cities not targeted are warned im worried that sooner or later one of those missiles may hit my city like my parents place naumovych said naumovych arrived in the us almost 11 years ago he had about 440 to his name then he said and started a landscaping business he sold years later for more than 1 million im worried that sooner or later one of those missiles may hit my city like my parents place i love this country like you can come with 400 and six seven years later you can be a millionaire he said one of his big worries for ukraine now is its economy with so many people out of work because of the war and inflation projected to hit 30 the economy is in bad shape naumovych said a lot of people left ukraine and im not sure theyre coming back the parents of software engineer serhiy vorobiov 43 are near the wars front line in zaporizhzhya a russianspeaking region that includes europes largest nuclear power plant russia has captured the plant and ukrainians and others fear they will use it for blackmail but vorobiov said his parents only 25 miles from the front lines in the city of zaporizhzhya still think everything is relatively safe he said he chats with them with about the same frequency as before the war maybe because there is no very high emergency at this point i know its not to my defense but thats how it is he said vorobiov his wife oksana 33 and their three young children yaromyr myroslava and oksana have lived in the us since 2020 he said the war has reinforced his belief in getting rid of any russian influence on their upbringing i always dreamed of it i just didnt want to be very tough in that but now i have all the rights and i want to use it vorobiov said i want them to forget the russian language we are from the russianspeaking part of ukraine but now we are fixing it as much as we can forget russian forget we were ever together forget soviet union im happy they dont know what soviet union is but in her remarks to open the festivities oksana markarova the ukrainian ambassador to the united states advised focusing on the present not the past please be joyful today she counseled she said russian leader vladimir putin and the russians want ukrainians to sit down and cry at the devastation this is what russians want us to do and we will not give it to them

environment kirkland wash the rev kara markell pastor of lake washington christian church recalled how unbreathable it often became inside her previous church in texas sunday best for some people includes ample amounts of smellnice the idea that perfumes may pose health risks may never cross the mind but nestled in the woods of a seattle suburb markells new parish offers a sanctuary from scents a fragrancefree campaign asks members and visitors to forego perfumes aftershave and scented lotions on sundays meanwhile the church is swapping out perfumed products throughout the building including cleaners candles air fresheners and bathroom soaps i love it said markell cleaner air that gives a reprieve to chemicalsensitive churchgoers ties in with her congregations green church designation as well as its position on inclusion centuries of men and women have sought out sweet scents for the pleasure of themselves and others perhaps nowhere is that more evident than a church sanctuary filled with fragrant candles and a cocktail of colognes as a verse in the bibles book of proverbs reads ointment and perfume delight the heart but at the time the bible was written scents were basic like pure frankincense and myrrh today theyre likely an undisclosed mixture of petrochemicals modern chemical fragrances are also incorporated into a long list of products from detergents and deodorants to dryer sheets and hair sprays the pervasiveness of synthetic scents according to experts threatens the health of many people whether they realize it or not while a small fraction of americans are hypersensitive to scents many may be subtly affected and at increased risk of future health problems from living in an invisible fog of chemicals fragrance is just one piece of the problem they say with chemical ingredients that can include carcinogens neurotoxins and hormone disruptors almost everything we use has chemical scent added said joseph heimlich an expert in environmental education and community involvement at the ohio state university what does clean smell like it doesnt heimlich added but weve been conditioned through media and society that it should smell like lemons or mountain fresh the fragrance industry asserts the benefits of scents whether natural manmade or designed to smell like nature these products contribute to our overall quality of life and wellbeing elena solovyov a spokeswoman for the international fragrance association an industry trade group told the huffington post consumers can be assured that the fragrance used in their favorite products is safe solovyov said noting that individual ingredients are evaluated for consumer and environmental safety and that products are tested according to all government and companyspecific requirements the fragrance industry sets its own standards and facilitates its own safety reviews with help from outside experts thats little comfort for people who find it unbearable to venture inside churches workplaces schools or even the grocery store there are people out there who would like to go to church but they cant said gina blum an elder at lake washington christian church who spent weeks compiling a list of products and their disclosed ingredients to help identify the safest alternatives for the church and its members blum said she is mildly sensitive to scents linda moreno another member with mild sensitivity said her daughter kelsey 22 cant even walk past someone wearing perfume on the street without getting sick moreno called kelseys hypersensitivity multiple chemical sensitivity a controversial condition the american medical association studied it in 1991 but found no scientific evidence that supports the contention that multiple chemical sensitivity syndrome is a significant cause of disease rj mills an ama spokesperson told huffpost until accurate reproducible and wellcontrolled studies are available mills said the ama believes that multiple chemical sensitivity should not be considered a recognized syndrome dr philip ranheim an environmental medicine doctor based in lake stevens wash who has dealt with chemical sensitivity issues himself said the controversy will likely continue theres not a lot of money and time and effort going into defining it more fully said ranheim who attends a church unable to address his condition other countries such as england and japan have had governmentassociated environmental centers for studying chemical sensitivity but theres bias against it in this country ranheim added i think were addicted to chemicals and some people dont want to admit theres a downside to it a review of research published in may concluded that one significant exposure or the accrual of repeated lowlevel exposures seems to overload and impair the bodys ability to tolerate chemicals at that point minute amounts of diverse everyday chemicals can trigger symptoms the larger the total body burden of toxins suggests the review the greater the degree of hypersensitivity studies in the early 2000s estimated that 12 percent to 16 percent of americans are hypersensitive to chemicals i think the numbers are increasing its becoming an epidemic said anne steinemann a coauthor on one of those studies and a visiting researcher at scripps institution of oceanography at the university of california san diego her response when she first heard of lake washington christian churchs campaign to address chemical sensitivity hallelujah to some extent were all affected by chemicals steinemann added in fact those with acute symptoms such as migraine headaches asthma attacks heart palpitations or skin rashes after exposures may act as proverbial canaries in the coal mine when it comes to toxic chemicals and their subtle or future effects on others according to some experts interviewed by huffpost but avoiding chemical fragrances they added is made difficult by their pervasiveness and by scant regulation solovyov the fragrance industry spokeswoman confirmed there is no official definition for the industry terms unscented or fragrancefree the former can include fragrance ingredients that actually mask odors she also said fragrance formulas are protected as trade secrets ingredients are rarely disclosed even full disclosure of chemicals offers little information on their ultimate toxicity according to steinemann the solution is to use truly natural or simple products like our grandparents used vinegar baking soda hydrogen peroxide lemon juice from a real lemon she said people with fragrance sensitivities usually dont react to aromatic flowers fruits or other truly natural smells added steinemann its often claimed that fragrance chemicals such as limonene are natural but there is a difference between the limonene as found in an orange and limonene made in a lab janine ridings of bellevue wash became housebound after an extreme exposure to jet fuel fumes in 1998 a short while later she began an online prayer group aroma of christ to provide fellowship and encouragement for others dealing with multiple chemical sensitivity ridings said she has been fortunate that a couple local churches accommodated her needs with everything from fragrancefree windowed rooms outside the sanctuary to air freshenerfree restrooms if churches could just get air fresheners out of restrooms that would help a lot she said lake washington christian church made that step and the churchs fragrancefree efforts continue this month the church held a screening of the environmental documentary chemerical which explores the dangers of chemicals to clean our bodies and homes and offers recipes for toxicfree alternatives the films producer andrew nisker recommended first targeting laundry and dishwashing detergents which he suggested have some of the worst health and environmental impacts nisker has produced a cookbook of makeyourown cleaning products the environmental working group meanwhile offers a free database and guides to help identify the least toxic and fragrancefree personal care and cleaning products on the market policy is not going to change unless people change and stop buying products full of toxins nisker told huffpost consumer pressure may be responsible for announcements this fall from target and walmart both big box stores said they will begin rating products based on suspect chemicals this week reckitt benckiser maker of lysol woolite and airwick reported plans to disclose chemicals in its fragrances raising awareness in the religious community may be a powerful avenue for further change said nisker a lot of politics whether we like it or not has influenced policy for good or for bad and theres a lot of religion in politics he said ohio states heimlich agreed that churches are key venues for environmental progress churches are often a place where people are paying attention to things they may not pay attention to elsewhere

fast today more couples than ever are turning to in vitro fertilization or ivf to conceive children ivf is an assisted reproductive technology where fertilization happens by manually combining an egg and sperm in a laboratory dish and then transferring the embryo to the uterus in 2014 more than 65000 babies were conceived with the help of ivf representing 16 percent of the 40 million births in the us over the past decade the number of ivf procedures have skyrocketed nearly 50 from 113000 in 2003 to over 165000 today this trend has been catalyzed on the back of decreasing costs of the procedure and increased pregnancy rates over the past 10 years ivf costs have fallen from 20000 to 10000 per procedure while pregnancy rates have increased from 20 to 50 ivf in combination with an egg donor is creating an opportunity for the 61 million women in the united states who suffer from infertility issues or are too old to have a baby in 2015 over 17000 ivf procedures used an egg donor ivf also allows couples to fertilize many eggs at a time eight to 10 on average grow them to the blastocyst stage sequence a cell from each blastocyst and then select the healthiest for implantation into the mothers womb i believe that eventually ivf might in fact be the standard and most widely accepted way to reproduce as women continue to further their education and their careers many women face deep anxiety when considering having children later in life since fertility rates decrease by twothirds by the age of 40 but one new technological solution might help solve this problem the ability to freeze ones healthy eggs earlier in life egg freezing has started to become a way for women to reproduce on a timetable of their own choice not dictated by their own biology the number of women choosing to freeze their eggs at fertility clinics in the us grew more than sevenfold between 2009 and 2013 carl djerassi inventor of the contraceptive pill commented on this trend saying in the next 20 years more young people will freeze their eggs and sperm in their 20s and bank them for later use they will do away with the need for contraception by being sterilized and withdraw their eggs and sperm from the bank when they are ready to have a child via ivf if you had the ability to tinker with the genetics of your baby would you what if you could prevent a hereditary disease might it become unethical to not correct genetic errors since we discovered crisprcas9 a tool used to edit the human genome with incredible precision these questions are no longer theoretical and philosophical they are very very real just three years after its initial development crispr technology is already widely used by biologists as a kind of searchandreplace tool to alter dna even down to the level of a single letter by editing the dna of these cells or the embryo itself germline engineering it could be possible to correct disease genes and pass those genetic fixes on to future generations such a technology could be used to rid families of scourges like cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy this historymaking medical advance could be as important to this century as vaccines were to the last by some measures us public opinion is not particularly negative toward the idea of genetically modifying babies a pew research survey carried out last august found that 46 percent of adults approved of genetic modification of babies to reduce the risk of serious diseases interestingly the same survey found that 83 percent said genetic modification to make a baby smarter would be taking medical advances too far at least three other centers in the united states are working on germline engineering as are scientists in china in the uk and at a biotechnology company called ovascience based in cambridge massachusetts that boasts some of the worlds leading fertility doctors on its advisory board and has raised over 132 million the objective of these groups is to demonstrate that its possible to produce children free of specific genes involved in inherited disease if its possible to correct the dna in a womans egg or a mans sperm those cells could be used in an in vitro fertilization ivf clinic to produce an embryo and then a child it might also be possible to directly edit the dna of an earlystage ivf embryo using crispr life as we know it is becoming programmable these changes are happening fast in the next decade or so beyond that in the far future things get even crazier exponential technologies in the next 20 years are going to play a huge role in the way in which we decided to bring life into this world here are three amazing new approaches that may represent the future of reproduction humanity is moving from evolution by natural selection darwinism to evolution by intelligent direction at an accelerating pace from the advent of birth control in 1960 to crisprcas9 today we as humans are being given tremendous control on how and when we choose to reproduce technologies like crisprcas9 cut to the core of who we are as people and it makes us ask whether humans should be exercising that kind of power especially with features like eye color hair color height intelligence and athletic ability these are moral and ethical issues but in any case its clear that technology is forever changing the course of human development and procreation

sports hipster football a sometimes pejorative shorthand for various forms of interest in football from a love of obscure tactical facets of the game to an appreciation of teams youve never heard of but should love given the usually dedicated nature of football fandom why do we develop crushes on certain teams and why do we call that hipster anyway humans are essentially herd animals whose choices are largely determined by the group or more interestingly by key influencers within the group this is the key tenet of mark earls book herd which examines how humans behave with a view to understanding consumer action from a marketing perspective earls argues that humans are collective and empathetic qualities that have developed in an evolutionary time scale as necessary qualities for survival among a species that develops emotionally and consciously through interaction with others he also argues that humans try to act as individuals and perceive themselves as individuals and that this is done for several reasons western philosophy has taught us that the individuals free will and responsibility is of primary importance individuals tend to retrospectively justify their decisions by effacing the herd aspect to fit into this reading of culture and our ability to misremember the origins of our decisions assists this process recognition that key influencers shape opinion is not new and research by consumer groups has identified this quality in certain individuals who can shape opinion and sentiment by their utterances earls takes this a step further and adds that these individuals who he labels superconductors are in fact influential by their nature and their ability to frame a narrative rather than simply state it this places a greater importance on both style and credibility of a narrative rather than just the basic number of people exposed to a superconductors opinion these individuals are not didactic but influence by example and exposure rather than simply telling us what we should like their communication is an example of what earls terms endogenous wordofmouth that is generated socially within the system rather than parachuted in from an external body in his discussion the difference would be between sociallygenerated buzz and direct marketing this form of wordofmouth communication is more lasting and more influential people in their desire to appear individual are more likely to adopt something if it is not directly shoved at them but rather if it is discussed and made to look interesting and popular with no overt attempt to persuade hipsters are very well socialized people an individual who is well attuned to prevailing herd behaviour they are receptive to endogenous influence and adept at copying but like all humans are also quick to assert the essential individuality of their choices the coalescence of hipster choice is a reflection of the herd nature of their decision but also of the quality of their decisionmaking and so finally to football how do hipster clubs come about in a way ive already shown how i will answer this question though there are nuances that apply to football we all have different reasons for pledging to a club but our affection is usually intransigent increasingly however people are stating affection for teams largely based abroad as a second third and even onwards club while our choice of first team doesnt change there is a fluid appreciation of other clubs and often these affections are for the socalled hipster teams and are quite centered on certain predictable outfits the two clear examples of this in the last three years are barcelona and borussia dortmund easy choices you might say they play fast attacking at times breathtaking football they have young teams they play with an ethos they had or have charismatic coaches who are urbane and witty they dont need heart and character and running all day to win games and indeed thats pretty much it we like these teams because theyre great teams but and this is why i droned on about earls earlier we are pulled into these choices social media and the more social forms of journalism such as blogging or opinionheavy quality writing such as sometimes found on the guardian feature these teams more than others there are various reasons for this in part there is a natural antithesis to the english game harumscarum rushing about in the better print media and blogosphere these writers will naturally advocate teams who do not suffer from what are commonly perceived as english flaws this extends to the metanarrative of the national game where both barcelona and dortmund with a core of homegrown players raised in a philosophy of football which elevates touch control and creativity and after a concerted effort by the national governing bodies of those countries to create just such a philosophy contrast markedly with the perceived lack of skill and planning in our own national team setup we can appreciate not just the skill of these teams but the philosophy that generated them that is the narrative at least and it allows us to bemoan similar failings at home the journalistic system is predisposed towards elevating certain styles of play schools of football and once these teams and styles are so elevated it is natural for the herd for follow these teams will then enter a mainstream discourse and the herd will notice and claim that discovery for themselves and thus the team becomes hipster i chose at the behest of some other football writers teams i feel will become hipster these are anderlecht basel real sociedad dinamo zagreb fiorentina atheltic bilbao swansea and austria wien and marseille and napoli as maybes these teams all fit the criteria above to a greater or lesser extent most have a spine of young homegrown players all play attacking pressing football for the most part and all are featuring in european competition which makes them more likely subjects for mainstream media articles basels victory over chelsea is significant in this regard and they have two very exciting young egyptian players which opens another set of potential narratives we remain

upandcoming members of the new golden generation of belgian footballers another country that unlike england has poured money and effort into nurturing youth and are now reaping the benefits additionally la real and athletic have an interesting political dimension zagreb are automatically more likely because jonathan wilson a key influencer writes a lot about eastern european football and swansea are premier league but not english which is considered a benefit you can like them and laudrup without forsaking your own epl team i would say though that despite the reaction when they recently played dortmund i am a bit more dubious about napoli they do not fit my model so easily though the urban gritty setting of the team like with marseille adds credibility for a certain type of hipster anyway for all these reasons the clubs listed above are attractive teams for superconductors to write about them and write they will the herd will simply follow as they did with barcelona and dortmund i want to touch lastly on two other teams very briefly st pauli and st etienne are both in my opinion hipster teams of a more durable quality st pauli as described marvellously in the blizzards issue zero are a team rooted in leftwing politics and the alternative which automatically makes them a contender hipsters love the outsider precisely because they are not mainstream they are also wellbranded and appeal from a visual perspective everyone loves a piratical skull and crossbones st etienne are evocative of a bygone era of elegance gallic flair and insouciant cool and have featured in some of the best european cup games and have cropped up in the blizzard a number of times without doubt probably the single biggest superconductor by virtue of reach quality and aesthetic values which make it a very easy thing to admire and therefore follow the great thing for hipsters about football is that you can flit from one club to another when it comes to crushes you may be stuck with hartepool but there is nothing to stop you tuning into st etienne vs bastia and getting all quivery about it the ephemeral trending nature of these clubs fits with the fluidity of social networks and allows a football lover to stay true to their first choice while demonstrating knowledge interest and sociability by being interested in other teams because they are more highly socialized hipsters are more receptive to this trending and less concerned about staying fixed to one club or brand anyway it will be of course interesting to see if im right in my choices the great thing is by writing about them ive already started the process sneaky right sources mark earls advertising to the herd market research society annual conference 2003 mark earls and dr alex bentley

health in todays world of information overload and unrelenting messages about everything from the economy to terrorism its pretty difficult to feel calm fortunately sarah mclean has put together a meditation plan that is extremely accessible to the average person i interviewed mclean when she was in new york to introduce her new book soulcentered transform your life in 8 weeks with meditation she has described her program as decidedly mainstream before meeting i had read several chapters visited her website and listened to the first track on her guided meditations cd why meditate in the opening pages studies were referenced showing the effects of meditation decreased anxiety and depression enhanced immunity normalized blood sugar reduction of chronic pain and lowered cholesterol a january 2011 article published in the journal psychiatry research neuroimaging related that researchers at massachusetts general hospital had found that after two months of meditating for an average of 27 minutes daily there was a positive physical change in the gray matter of the brain during our talk mclean recounted the story of her personal evolution over two decades with activities ranging from serving as a behavior specialist in the military medical corps to living in a zen buddhist monastery in a remote part of southern california she was the program manager at the deepak chopra center spent time in afghan refugee camps and served as a director at byron katies school for the work mcleans demeanor was open and unaffected as i peppered her with questions about integrating stillness and mindfulness into daily life mclean admitted that her biggest challenge coming out of the monastery was having to keep my center in todays world part of that path includes making choices not to be overstimulated and spending time with people you enjoy while covering the nuts and bolts of her program our conversation touched on her philosophy which is woven throughout the text safety is not external its a state of mind mclean explained feeling loved is a perspective she added when you have a lot of stress in your nervous system nothing feels good soulcentered is a term that mclean uses to explain a persons relationship to life that is harmonious regardless of circumstances when you are soulcentered you are not dependent on others for your selfworth commenting on why it is unwise to look to outside circumstances for validation mclean noted wryly the worlds a shaky place mclean has had her share of obstacles including a bout with thyroid cancer and a period when she lived out of her car in meditation you learn to be brave she told me you move toward selfcompassion courage and bearing witness through meditation one trains to take care of their own personal peace while moving beyond an established belief system in order to embrace a wider perspective everybody has different software mclean said but it is essential for each individual to live in their own integrity mclean defined that phrase as expressing ones self authentically its having what you think what you say and what you do be aligned humans have 60000 to 90000 thoughts per day when we meditate it changes our focus mcleans approach underscores ease and effortlessness no expectations she notes reassuringly its natural to experience other stuff its about shifting awareness when you meditate you go beyond the ego which is all about preserving who you are and what youve got mclean also covers related topics like selfsufficiency which enables you to be the navigator of your own path dont compare yourself to others is also top advice attention should be in the present moment life doesnt not take place in the past or in the future it is happening right now mcclean states its never too late to gain an understanding of how to share yourself authentically in the world the scientific findings show that meditation helps the neurons in the brain to develop new connections regardless of an individuals age because of neuroplasticity we can then move forward by responding to a situation creatively instead of habitually meditation is a preventative tool that allows the body to enter a restful awareness response as opposed to the fight or flight response it increases levels of endorphins and serotonin cultivating responsiveness rather than reactivity mclean advises putting time for meditation into your schedule like an important meeting part of her overview is to break behaviors such as mindlessly jumping to answer the phone without acknowledging that you have choices my favorite tip was the peacefinder exercise used to counteract a stressful situation through altering body response by closing your eyes and going inward for 30 seconds breath can be used as a stabilizing force mclean recommends repeating an affirmation such as all is well im doing the best that i can selflove selfkindness accepting your body these are all components of mcleans prescription for a compassionate attitude that minimizes senses of insecurity defensiveness and feeling threatened selfapproval is not always easy to achieve mclean suggests exercises for transforming negative habits about how you think about yourself and others the ultimate goal is to be soulcentered rather than egocentered then your selfworth is not contingent upon others opinions of you in essence you change the reference point by which you navigate life mclean believes that in order to find love you must fall in love with yourself first mclean advocates a onedayamonth retreat the parameters are unplugging from responsibilities electronics schedules and a preconceived notion of what you should be doing she views silence as food for health mclean further describes how to experience a noble silence which means simply being withdraw from actions outside of yourself such as listening to music writing reading and talking this gives the nervous system deep rest and a chance to rejuvenate we all have access to our own peace creating our center as a touchstone we can count on mclean told me its essential just like brushing your teeth she continued walk in nature daily do one thing at a time say yes when you mean yes and no when you mean no let go of the need for approval from others practice gratitude contemplating her outreach about meditations benefits

fighting since the 2014 war at least nine palestinians including a pregnant woman and her 14monthold niece have also been killed israeli forces struck dozens of targets throughout gaza including militant sites that the military said were concealed in homes or residential areas the army also moved armored units toward gaza as the sides headed closer to allout war israel and hamas are bitter enemies that have fought three wars since the islamic militant group seized control of gaza in 2007 as well as numerous smaller flareups most recently in late march these flareups have become increasingly frequent in recent years ending in informal egyptianmediated truces in which israel pledges to ease a crippling blockade on gaza imposed after the hamas takeover while the militants promise to halt rocket fire as with previous rounds of fighting the latest violence began late last week amid palestinian accusations that israel was not moving quickly enough to ease the blockade in sundays fighting moshe agadi a 58yearold israeli father of four was struck in the chest by shrapnel in a residential courtyard the barzilai medical center said a 49yearold man was killed when a rocket hit an ashkelon factory while a second man was killed when his vehicle was hit by a projectile near yad mordechai a small border community later sunday israeli medical officials said a thai laborer was critically wounded in a rocket strike by late afternoon the israeli military said militants had fired over 600 rockets into israel and that israeli forces had launched some 260 airstrikes against militant targets in gaza palestinian health officials reported nine dead including six militants the other dead included a pregnant woman and her niece who were killed in what the officials said was an israeli airstrike the israeli military denied involvement saying the woman and baby were killed by a misfired palestinian rocket there was no way to reconcile the conflicting accounts palestinian officials identified one of the militants as hamas commander hamed alkhoudary who israel said was a key player in transferring iranian money to the militant group the sudden outburst has broken a monthlong lull as egyptian mediators had been trying to negotiate a longterm ceasefire israeli military spokesman lt col jonathan conricus said israels strikes hit a variety of highquality militant sites including commanders homes in which militant activity was observed the military spokesman said israel was deploying an armored brigade along the gaza front with tanks ready for offensive missions as needed the israeli military has already struck rocket launchers tunnel shafts training sites storage depots and warehouses of both the territorys hamas rulers and the smaller iranianbacked islamic jihad group israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said hamas was paying a heavy price for its rocket attacks as well as those by islamic jihad sirens wailed along the border region overnight and throughout the day warning of incoming attacks school was canceled and roads were closed in gaza large explosions thundered across the blockaded enclave during the night as plumes of smoke rose into the air by morning bulldozers were clearing rubble and municipal workers were fixing damaged power lines owners of clothing stores that were destroyed in gaza citys relatively upscale remal neighborhood squatted across the streets from where their stores had stood cupping their faces in their hands one of the airstrikes hit a sixstory commercial and residential building that housed the office of turkeys official anadolu news agency we thought the rimal neighborhood is safe but it seems there is no safe place in gaza said nidal aldali who lived in the building and lost his home turkish foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu called it a new example of israels unrestrained aggression the israeli military said its iron dome defense system intercepted more than 150 of the projectiles from gaza but several still managed to slip through a rocket scored a direct hit on a residential home in the border town of sderot dr ron lobel deputy director of the barzilai medical center in ashkelon said teams had treated over 110 people most from shock symptoms but several with physical wounds in a first the hospital itself was also hit by debris from a rocket that was intercepted by an iron dome missile there were no injuries but the debris struck the hospitals oncology unit bursting a pipe and sending water pouring from a ceiling into the hallway israel has vowed to hit back hard against both hamas and islamic jihad whom it suspects of triggering the current conflagration but as in previous rounds where it stopped short of a fullfledged war the timing for a prolonged round of fighting is tricky for israel the country marks memorial day and independence day this week the following week it is set to host the eurovision song contest in which large groups of tourists are expected for gazans the violence comes ahead of the muslim holy month of ramadan in which the faithful fast from dawn to dusk which begins monday in recent days hamas accused israel of reneging on its pledges as militants began to fire rockets israel accuses islamic jihad of operating behind hamas back and instigating the latest round of violence by shooting and wounding two israeli soldiers on friday two palestinians were shot dead by israeli forces the same day during weekly protests along the israelgaza perimeter fence yaakov amidror a former israeli national security adviser said the violence was being instigated by islamic jihad at the behest of their backers in iran amidror currently a senior fellow at the jerusalem institute for strategy and security said a new war in gaza would distract israel and leave tehran free to continue what they are doing in syria iran is allied with president bashar assads forces in the civil war and has been building up a military presence

science british physicist stephen hawking may have died in march but his legacy is still unfolding the prominent theoretical physicist and cosmologist coauthored a research paper about the existence of parallel universes similar to our own which the journal of highenergy physics posthumously published on friday according to the bbc the study was submitted to the openaccess journal shortly before hawkings death thomas hertog a coauthor of the study told the bbc that he and hawking were wrestling with the idea that the big bang actually resulted in the creation of multiple pocket universes that exist throughout space it was unclear to them whether the laws of physics that apply in our universe would also apply in these alternate universes in the old theory there were all sorts of universes some were empty others were full of matter some expanded too fast others were too shortlived there was huge variation said hertog a physics professor at the catholic university of leuven ku leuven in belgium the mystery was why do we live in this special universe where everything is nicely balanced in order for complexity and life to emerge hertog and hawkings paper uses new mathematical techniques to restore order to previously chaotic views of the multiverse suggesting that these different universes are subject to the same laws of physics as our own it reduces the multiverse down to a more manageable set of universes which all look alike said hertog whose paper with hawkings drew on 20 years of work the physicists also gave other researchers a pathway to potentially detect the presence of other universes by searching for cosmic microwave radiation that is left over from the big bang hertog said that communication became more difficult near the end of hawkings life although the physicist apparently never showed signs of wanting to quit along with his recently published study hawking has at least two other papers that are being prepared for publication according to the guardian we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again hawking died at the age of 76 on march 14 due to complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis a progressive neurodegenerative disease he rose to global fame in 1988 after publishing a general audience book on science a brief history of time in the world of astrophysics hes best known for his theories on black holes hawkings ashes will be interred inside londons westminster abbey later this year near the graves of scientists isaac newton and charles darwin

worldnews in el salvador the dead are almost innumerable but not forgotten robert muggah pontifical catholic university of rio de janeiro pucrio in the 1990s the capital of colombias mountainous antioquia province medellin had one of the worlds highestever recorded murder rates 380 homicides per 100000 people after national authorities wrested control of the citys poorest communities from paramilitaries mayor sergio fajardo rolled out an entirely new approach to quelling violence it was known as urban acupuncture a core tenet of this approach to social urbanism involved pinprick interventions in neighbourhoods experiencing extreme poverty and chronic violence government and business invested in firstclass community centres schools and public transit using parks gondolas and escalators to bring different parts of the city together the results were stunning today homicides in medellin are around 20 per 100000 and falling around the same time some 250 kilometres to the south mayor antanas mockus was governing colombias wartorn capital bogot starting in 1995 he increased the citys police budget tenfold introduced alternative sentencing for nonviolent offenders created a new violence prevention department refurbished rundown public spaces and vastly expanded health and education services for vulnerable citizens by 2003 bogotas homicides had dropped from 59 per 100000 to 25 per 100000 escalators move tens of thousands of people in medellin bringing disconnected neighbourhoods into the fold for over a decade the latin americas homicide rate has been at least three times the global average why has the rest of the region failed to grasp these lessons latin americas homicide rates are consistently three times higher than those of other regions in the world asterisks denote projections latin america is where the most murders in the world happen in 2016 at least 43 of the 50 most homicidal cities in the world led by san salvador el salvador acapulco mexico and san pedro sula honduras were located in the region roughly four latin americans are killed every 15 minutes things arent bad everywhere argentina costa rica ecuador peru uruguay and in particular chile with its homicide rate of 27 per 100000 are relatively safe even so their combined average homicide rate of 65 per 100000 is twice that of north america meanwhile brazil 283 per 100000 colombia 219 el salvador 912 guatemala 273 honduras 591 mexico 17 and venezuela 58 together account for one in every four homicides on earth latin america experiences 144000 homicides annually theres no single solution for preventing lethal violence but datadriven interventions like those pioneered by colombian mayors two decades ago are more likely to help latin americans than many current approaches which range from near apathy in venezuela to repressive policing in brazil el salvador and mexico though different medellin and bogotas homicide reduction strategies shared key features both set hard targets generated highquality data for analysis reformed police and the justice sector mended social ties in fragmented communities and confiscated illegal weapons they also benefited from informal pacts with heavily armed factions not unlike the controversial 2012 gang truce that led to a temporary peace in el salvador rather than replicate these experiences latin american governments have responded to rising violence by sinking more money into police forces prosecutors and prisons today the region annually invests between us55 and us70 billion in public security says the interamerican development bank and criminal violence costs the equivalent of 35 of total regional gdp in lost productivity insurance premiums and security provision both public and private that adds up to us261 billion a year or us300 per person even so only 20 of every 100 murders in latin america results in conviction the global rate is 43 in 100 in caracas or san salvador 10 of cases are cleared versus new yorks 68 and tokyos 98 meanwhile prisons are bursting at the seams many factors contribute to latin americas homicide problem among them the war on drugs abundant unlicensed firearms persistently unequal gender relations and in mexico and central america thousands of marginalised uprooted and sometimes convicted us deportees among the roughly 17000 people murdered each year in mexico dozens of journalists a growing body of scholarship on homicide in the region should help policymakers identify the most important drivers to craft better antiviolence programs inequality is high on that list latin america is home to ten of the worlds 15 most unequal countries and while the relationship between inequality and violent crime is not causal there is evidence of a strong correlation concentrated poverty plays a role for example world bank scholars recently found that an increase teen pregnancies in latin america is associated with 05 to 06 additional murders per 100000 people meanwhile in medelln a 1 rise in permanent income generated a 04 reduction in homicides the region is highly urbanised with roughly 85 of people living in cities and this has an important role in latin americas levels of violence across the globe homicidal violence tends to be hyperconcentrated in peripheral urban areas experiencing chronic disadvantage cities especially fastgrowing ones offer certain intrinsic opportunities for criminal activity anonymity for instance prospective victims and dilapidated infrastructure compounded by economic neglect and scarce basic services cities also have a higher density of actual and wouldbe offenders unemployed young men about 13 of latin americas 108 million 15to24yearolds are unemployed which has encouraged a small number of them to commit aspirational crime data suggests that latin americas murderers are by and large young out of work out of school and out of options in brazil studies show that a 1 rise in unemployment rates for men results in a 21 spike in homicides the regions weak security and justice institutions only worsen this violence epidemic some venezuelan prisons are literally under the control of gangs while in brazil jails have become death traps and police kill with impunity meanwhile mexican citizens profoundly distrust their government in brazil riots in overcrowded jails have killed hundreds such frailties plague nations across the region and are exploited by gang bosses and political elites alike this allows violence impunity patronage and corruption to flourish many latin american politicians continue deftly sidestepping the issue blaming all violence on cartels and gangs alone while organised crime is heavily implicated in homicides it is only one manifestation of a sprawling cluster of social and economic problems to address these underlying risks public officials will need to replace ineffective iron fist strategies which have only fuelled violence and mass incarceration with concrete homicidereduction plans inspired by whats worked elsewhere take colombias experimentation with plan cuadrantes a blockbyblock crime prevention initiative as an example such hotspot policing as its known works because lethal violence tends to concentrate reliably in physical space overall more than 90 of all homicides occur in less than 2 of street addresses in bogot virtually all murders are committed in just 1 of the citys street corners the majority of murders also occur during just a few hours out of a typical week friday and saturday nights and on payday using new digital platforms law enforcement officials can now monitor criminal violence in real time and prevent lethal violence before it occurs brazil has registered positive outcomes with similar tactics in esprito santo recife rio de janeiro and so paulo although not all of these efforts were sustained over time very specific types of behaviours including prior violence contact with the law alcohol abuse and gun ownership are also associated with homicide perpetration and victimisation deterrencebased strategies that prioritise the most violent types of crime could show immediate results as the ceasefire project did in boston us and stay alive did in belo horizonte brazil and measures that improve school retention rates offer vocational training create quality jobs and provide life skills for atrisk youth in the hardest hit neighbourhoods would reap benefits in the longer term instinct for life a regional initiative launched by over 30 ngos and international agencies recommends evidencebased policymaking to help cut latin americas murder rate in half over the next decade every 15 minutes a latin american is killed how to change this situation learn more httpstcoahxckac7mz pictwittercomcorrepnzyz the campaign is advocating for reductions of on average 75 a year in homicidebeset brazil colombia el salvador guatemala honduras mexico and venezuela if successful more than 365000 lives could be spared the goal is bold but also necessary and feasible medellin and bogot proved years ago that violence is not chronic latin americans numb after decades of bloodshed dont have

social it is a question that can intrigue excite and be discussed on many levels and platforms from an academic standpoint one may ask whose future of learning what context in which continent country and city is there any past research available and why is this inquiry important now therefore this topic made me fly 6000 plus miles to the magical kingdom of 6 appian way harvard graduate school of education where the brightest of minds meet conceptualize ideas and have often more or less changed or trained the world during sessions at harvard we looked into the future of learning through the lens of globalization digital revolution and mindbrain research the high energy and representation from around the world made me realize that the future of learning is on the mind of most nations of the world everyone seemed curious excited but also uncertain about where this journey would take him or her however we soon realized that no one really had the perfect answers or models because of the nature of the question still while looking at the future of learning we as a cohort realized that asking the right questions was as important as the answers because exploration gives birth to great ideas listed below are some of my reflections on the future of learning for proper learning to occur whether it was in the past now in the present or in the future great teachers are always indispensable during my interactions i realized that most educators from different parts of the world believe that learning must adapt to the style and needs of the knowledge seeker essentially this means that we question the whole process of standardized testing systems how can we give students a common standard test when we all agree that each student is unique digital revolution is a boon and it really has put all the data on our fingertips but now the onus is on us what we do with this data how we process this information and turn into practical usefulness will be a key skill for the future generationsthe real challenge will be to sift through this information strategically so that one can remain aware efficient and avoid information overload globalization is not a new phenomenon and it is beyond introducing coca cola or mcdonalds to third world countries we are one world with blurring boundaries and a melting pot of cultures therefore knowing about others rest of the world is as important as knowing about self if we get our dna checked we may trace our lineage to a place in the world that we may have never been to before globalization and digital revolution can make quality education accessible to countries like india prime minister narendra modi just launched the digital india initiative that is going to work on similar lines where worldclass faculty can connect and train learners in remote areas we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for your support along the way were truly grateful for readers like you your initial support helped get us here and bolstered our newsroom which kept us strong during uncertain times now as we continue we need your help more than ever we hope you will join us once again the intricacy capacity power and the endurance of the human mind is still not fully comprehensible however one thing is clear that we can train our mind in multiple ways and there is just not one way to learn we are born to learn the mind becomes stronger as it gets trained here i would like to end by quoting swami vivekananda who said that people should have muscles of iron nerves of steel inside which dwells a mind of the same material of which the thunderbolt is made hence the future of learning should be such that it gives greater flexibility to the learner confidence that the self can learn anything basic idea clarity on complex thoughts and processes strength of mind critical thinking practical application abilities employment awareness about the world at large and tolerance
politics democrats in congress were thrilled when president joe biden signed a landmark climate and health care bill into law last week but the moment felt bittersweet for some among them rep debbie dingell dmich dingell has been leading calls for a massive new investment in home and communitybased services or hcbs which is the set of programs and supports that help the elderly and people with disabilities to live independently the campaign has been personal for dingell who speaks frequently of the struggles she faced trying to find and coordinate care for her ailing husband former rep john dingell dmich in his final years eighteen months ago it looked like that campaign was on the cusp of success when a major hcbs proposal was part of bidens build back better blueprint for coming legislation and it wasnt just hcbs getting a white house push similarly sweeping proposals for child care and paid leave were also in the plan together they formed a caregiving agenda with a goal to create for the us something that already exists in most economically advanced countries a cradletograve guarantee that people will have assistance and care at the most vulnerable periods of their lives but with waferthin majorities and no realistic prospect of republican support democratic leaders were at the mercy of more conservative members who wanted a smaller less ambitious bill the caregiving items were competing for resources alongside other initiatives and the pool of resources kept shrinking with each round of negotiations until finally sen joe manchin dwva made clear he would withhold his makeorbreak 50th yea vote until democrats dropped everything but the climate and health provisions dingell did her part to make sure the bill passed celebrating the accomplishment with her colleagues but she couldnt stop thinking about the missing caregiving pieces including the hcbs initiative especially in the last few weeks when the issue once again became personal she was simultaneously trying to arrange ongoing care for her 88yearold mother who was about to leave the hospital following a cardiac emergency and once again struggling to identify and hire caregivers this system is so broken an exasperated dingell told huffpost in a phone interview ticking off problems shed had finding caregivers just think about what this is like for somebody who doesnt already know how to be an advocate how to get things organized think about how much it costs and all the people who cant afford it dingell said the experience has only reinforced her determination to get something done we didnt get it done but i just look at that as an opportunity to begin again she said and she has plenty of company in a series of interviews over the past two weeks lawmakers aides and advocates who worked on the caregiving agenda said they were in the same mindset convinced that with more effort they could succeed and they really might especially in recent history success at major progressive reforms has followed highprofile significant failures whether it was the affordable care act rising from the rubble of the clinton health care plan or the new clean energy investments that biden just signed emerging in the wake of the failed attempt to enact a cap and trade emissions program a decade ago but that success didnt happen by accident it happened at least in part because democrats went through some serious introspection taking stock of what went wrong and why and how to avoid those problems in the future the caregiving agenda supporters huffpost interviewed all seemed to recognize this they said those conversations are already taking place and that they already have some pretty good ideas about where the last effort came up short but identifying problems is one thing solving them is quite another especially when the political obstacles to progressive change of any kind remain so formidable thats one reason the missed opportunity hurts so much the political conditions of these past two years felt more favorable to enacting a caregiving agenda than ever before the pandemic made clear how much families rely on paid care providers it also illuminated underlying problems like the chronically low pay of care workers and the inability of providers to raise fees which would allow them to boost pay because the current prices max out so many families one result has been widespread wellpublicized shortages of child care at least 16000 programs have closed down permanently while those that remain open are under immense strain from shortstaffing pressures elliot haspel senior program officer for early childhood education at the robins foundation told huffpost parents are hitting a wall of waitlists while those who can finagle a spot are paying even more exorbitant fees than before its not a complicated story a fragile sector shattered the same basic dynamic of underpaid employees and employers who cant or wont pay them more is creating the shortage of home care workers that dingell has seen firsthand and that has been generating headlines all across the country in some cases forcing seniors and people with disabilities to leave home and go back to institutional care settings the pandemic has also thrown a spotlight onto the need for guaranteed paid leave mainly by demonstrating what happens when workers dont have it they go to work sick infecting others or lose their wages and sometimes their jobs advocates had something else going for them in the recent reform push they were ready for the moment theyd been preparing for years putting together plans and legislation they also committed to working together which was no small thing given past rivalries and tension over competition for limited resources we had an agreement that we would lift all of these issues together that we would not be pitted against each other aijen poo president of the national domestic workers alliance told huffpost the unified front made them stronger and helped get buyin from democratic politicians including the 2020 presidential candidates all of whom included major caregiving proposals in their platforms they also won support from the business community mainly by demonstrating how care for children and elders along with paid leave helped to stabilize the workforce we didnt get it done but i just look at that as an opportunity to begin again but even as the corporate community was cheering on the caregiving initiatives it was fighting the tax increases to finance the new programs i think that had a huge influence said vicki shabo a longtime paid leave advocate who is now a senior fellow at new america a washingtonbased think tank and while the caregiving movement is a lot more organized than it was even a few years ago it doesnt have the kind of advocacy or lobbying strength to overcome that kind of resistance or even to ensure its priorities are something democrats must address its clear that the sector still needs to build its power said haspel who is also author of crawling behind americas childcare crisis and how to fix it parents of young children are not feared as a constituency and we simply dont have the money or political clout to throw around in the way that health care or climate or hedge fund managers do the lobbying numbers are pretty meager the common rationale for federal action on child care hcbs and paid leave is that society should take some collective responsibility for caregiving through public programs rather than letting it all fall on individual families but that can be a difficult message to get across when so many americans are unaccustomed to their government playing that role there is still a misimpression in the us that these programs and supports are not core to what the government should do shabo said one way to change that impression is to publicize the instances where it is happening in the us which for paid leave means talking about states like california colorado and maryland that have programs in place or are in the process of implementing them and documenting the results another is to try flipping the script on government action which critics frequently portray as infringements on individual liberty these programs create freedom poo said theyre enabling peoples participation in the economy freedom to help people with disabilities live independently and full actual lives whole lives they free us from the guilt and the shame that comes with feeling like a failure when you cant afford or manage the care advocates may also need to do a better job of simply conveying how farreaching the impacts of caregiving are partly to justify ambitious national action and partly to make sure people struggling in the current system realize its not their fault there is still a misimpression in the us that these programs and supports are not core to what the government should do this is not a niche issue poo said fiftythree million family caregivers and how many working parents who need child care and then the number of boomers and older adults who are going to need these services in the next 10 to 15 years the actual human cost and human impact of not moving on these issues and making progress i dont think its well enough understood i feel like we were starting to chip away at this but it is a deep profound challenge poo said for the caregiving agenda to become reality its supporters may have to do more than rethink politics they may need to rethink policy too by subjecting their ideas to more outside scrutiny and contemplating major changes one big question is the role of states both the child care and hcbs proposals put up a lot of federal money but depended on states taking the money and using it the hope was that even conservative state officials would not turn down a chance to help so many constituents this is more or less whats been happening during the pandemic advocates noted states have been accepting federal relief dollars to prop up child care without much political fuss but the child care and hcbs proposals that were part of build back better made the funds conditional on states making longterm changes to their programs and committing to a smallbutongoing contribution of state funding which as critics like matt bruenig of the peoples policy project pointed out sounds a lot more like the affordable care acts medicaid expansion that to this day a dozen republicanled states have rejected i feel like we were starting to chip away at this but it is a deep profound challenge figuring out a way to avoid this problem while still allowing for state flexibility where it makes sense as policy is something advocates say they are already contemplating whatever we come up with for hcbs going forward we want to make sure that every state red or blue gets the money said nicole jorwic chief of advocacy and campaigns at caring across generations a bigger question is whether to engage in some kind of more wholesale rethinking of the existing caregiving proposals like whether programs should devote some money to subsidizing people who stay home and provide care directly for loved ones this has been the one criticism conservatives and republicans frequently make about democratic child care plans that they dont do enough for stayathome parents rethinking proposals is never easy the difficult tradeoffs of policy and politics inevitably lead to lessthanideal solutions but the lawmakers and activists who spoke to huffpost all said they were willing to be flexible and compromise and pointed to concessions they made this past year as they tried to save elements of their agenda as proof i think sometimes there was sort of this idea that you know advocates were not willing to negotiate dawn huckelbridge director of paid leave for all told huffpost and i think in each of our cases that was absolutely not true she noted that original proposals for paid leave envisioned 12 weeks and that by the end supporters in and outside congress were willing to make do with as little as four figuring that once the plan was in place they would have opportunities to expand it what we often said was for the majority of people in this country who have zero days of paid leave this is transformative stuff huckelbridge said so of course were not going to turn that down the lawmakers and advocates who have been working on the caregiving agenda also said they were openminded about working with republicans whether its on shortterm fixes or longerterm plans as evidence of potential republican interest several noted that two gop senators richard burr of north carolina and tim scott of south carolina recently introduced a child care bill while their republican colleague from florida marco rubio has long promoted his own version of paid leave but a common theme in those gop proposals is a lack of new funding under rubios proposal for example workers effectively pay for their own leave by giving up some of their future social security retirement benefits absent real dollars youre just squeezing a balloon where either the workers or the families or both are sacrificing said melissa boteach vice president for income security and early learningchild care at the national womens law center not that democrats are always so helpful pledges never to raise taxes on the middle class can preclude social insurance schemes that rely on small payroll contributions which is how social security and medicare work and how paid leave programs in the states work i think the presidents tax pledge created huge problems for us shabo said all of that sounds like a lot of work ahead for the caregiving agendas champions and it probably is but theyve also made a lot of progress already coming within a few votes on capitol hill of enacting big pieces of their agenda as recently as a few years ago that would not have seemed possible because of the countless families who shared their stories congress is finally paying attention to the caregiving crisis said sen bob casey dpa another leader in the crusade for a new more comprehensive hcbs program for the first time democrats all agree we need to invest in home care for seniors and people with disabilities and the workers who care for them sen patty murray dwash who has spearheaded the child care campaign for years has also seen the difference when she first got to the senate in 1993 she said nobody on capitol hill wanted to discuss child care even though she knew as a working parent and former preschool teacher how many families were already struggling it was a silent epidemic murray told huffpost now child care gets far more attention murray said weve broadened the conversation created a real movement developed a knowledge base that gives you such a head start in politics at the same time murray added whether that head start amounts to anything depends on picking up where this years legislative effort left off we cant just vote on the last bill and call it a day she said of course the caregiving agendas future will depend on one other critical factor whether a majority of lawmakers support and are willing to fight for it the reality is that some version of the original caregiving proposals in build back better might be law today if the house and senate had even a handful of extra members who were committed to them we remain committed to providing you with the unflinching factbased journalism everyone deserves thank you again for

politics the justice department and donald trumps legal team proposed candidates friday for the role of an independent arbiter in the investigation into topsecret documents found at the former presidents florida home but the two sides differed on the scope of duties the person would have lawyers for trump said they believe the socalled special master should review all documents seized by the fbi during its search last month of maralago including records with classification markings and filter out any that may be protected by claims of executive privilege the justice department said it does not believe the arbiter should be permitted to inspect classified records or to take into account potential claims of executive privilege us district judge aileen cannon had given both sides until friday to submit potential candidates for the role of a special master as well as proposals for the scope of the persons duties and the schedule for his or her work the justice department submitted the names of two retired judges barbara jones who served on the federal bench in manhattan and performed the same role in prior highprofile investigations and thomas griffith a former federal appeals court jurist in the district of columbia the trump team proposed one retired judge raymond dearie also the former top federal prosecutor in the eastern district of new york and prominent florida lawyer paul huck jr the backandforth over the special master is playing out amid an fbi investigation into the retention of several hundred classified documents recovered from maralago within the past year though the legal wrangling is unlikely to have major longterm effects on the criminal investigation or knock it significantly off course it will almost certainly delay it and has already caused the intelligence community to temporarily pause a national risk assessment over the strenuous objections of the justice department cannon on monday granted the trump teams request for the special master and directed the department to temporarily halt its review of records for investigative purposes she said the person would be responsible for sifting through the records recovered during the aug 8 search of maralago and filtering out any documents potentially covered by claims of attorneyclient or executive privilege roughly 11000 documents including more than 100 with classified markings some at the topsecret level were recovered during the search thats on top of classified documents contained in 15 boxes retrieved in january by the national archives and records administration and additional sensitive government records the department took back during a june visit to maralago the justice department had objected to the trump teams request for a special master saying it had already completed its own review in which identified a limited subset of records that possibly involve attorneyclient privilege it has maintained that executive privilege does not apply in this investigation because trump no longer president had no right to claim the documents as his the department on thursday filed a notice of appeal indicating that it would contest the judges order to the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta officials asked the judge to lift her hold on their investigative work pending their appeal as well as her requirement that the department share with a special master the classified records that were recovered it is not clear whether trump or anyone else will be charged this is a developing story please check back for updates

entertainment not long ago i wrote about making ricotta at home ive made it several times since then both as written and in a sweet version without the garlic and herbs and jackie and i have been eating lots of it sometimes plain but mostly as an element of other dishes ive also discovered a versatile ingredient in the whey tart with lemon juice and with a fine dairy flavor here are some of the ricotta things weve eaten all of them can of course be prepared with ricotta that someone else has made if you use supermarket ricotta leave it in a fine sieve refrigerated to drain for 24 hours farmers market ricotta is usually dry and fluffy enough to use as is but keep your wits about you as you cook and if the dish needs tinkering with tinker away our new favorite food in the whole world is ricotta gnocchi made with the savory version as described in the original post the recipe works perfectly by weight so i wont give volume measures for two or three generous portions four to six starter portions use a wooden spoon or better a rubber spatula to beat an egg into 250 g ricotta then add 125 g flour and 60 g grated parmesan plus salt and pepper taste the resulting mixture for seasoning when kneaded for half a minute this should yield a dough thats firm enough not to be sticky but thats easy to form into a rope adjust as needed with additional flour or spoonfuls of whey or milk form a 58inch 16cm rope then cut it into gnocchi emulating our friend zoes boyfriend i use a sort of chinese rollcut cutting at a 45degree angle giving the rope a quarter turn then cutting again heres a video demonstrating the cut though i turn the rope toward rather than away from me as i go use immediately or hold in the fridge on a waxedpaperlined well floured tray or put the tray into the freezer until the gnocchi are hard then transfer them to a plastic bag for storage if not frozen they take five minutes to cook in gently boiling salted water use a skimmer to transfer them to the pan containing whatever sauce youre serving them with and toss to combine weve eaten these gnocchi with a simple tomato sauce with lots of freshly shelled peas cooked with spring onions chicken stock mint and butter and with mixedherb butter with a few peas and strips of lettuce topped with shredded ricotta salata storebought each one was the best thing wed ever tasted the gnocchi are tender but bouncy and are just so delicious move over potatoes the same herbgarlicinfused ricotta has found its way onto a pizza bianca too much more interesting than bland ricotta it would be excellent in calzone too or of course in ravioli from a little batch of ricotta made without the garlic and herbs but with some grated lemon zest i made an elegant dessert tart a small one about 6 inches 15 cm across i first completely baked the pastry shell 4 oz 115 g flour 25 oz 70 g butter a little simple syrup to hold it together and salt lined with aluminum foil and dried beans to keep it from bubbling up the filling was a good cup 250 ml by volume of ricotta vigorously beaten with 3 tablespoons 35 g of sugar a whole egg and an egg yolk plus a few very few rumsoaked raisins it took 15 minutes to set in a 350degree f 175 c oven and was served at room temperature ive done a number of things with the whey too in the original post i wrote about cooking spring garlic in whey then pureeing it into a creamy garlicky sauce ive since made mashed potatoes in a similar way and have also cooked small dice of new potatoes in whey then added them to that spring garlic puree this aromatic lemonytart saucevegetable was terrific served with scallops the whey has also ended up in two kinds of savory pancakes one was made with stale bread soaked in whey and broken down in the food processor to a sort of pap to which i added eggs sweated shallots and slivered herbs before cooking in oil flavored with butter bread pancakes of any kind are a great thing and the whey added a new dimension the other was a grand way of using a scant cup of leftover basmati rice that had been cooked as a gently spiced pilaf i warmed the rice in whey this softened the grains which were fridgehard pureed it with an immersion blender then added more whey an egg and lots of herbs the aroma of the basmati rice was striking and the tartness of the whey made perfect sense we eat yogurt with pilafs dont we could i have done all these things with storebought ricotta and say buttermilk yep would i not in the space of two weeks thats for sure and theres more to come ill bet

worldnews sept 6 reuters zimbabwes robert mugabe was feted as an african liberation hero and champion of racial reconciliation when he first came to power in a nation divided by nearly a century of white colonial rule nearly four decades later many at home and abroad denounced him as a powerobsessed autocrat willing to unleash death squads rig elections and trash the economy in the relentless pursuit of control mugabe was ultimately ousted by his own armed forces in november 2017 he demonstrated his tenacity some might say stubbornness to the last refusing to accept his expulsion from his own zanupf party and clinging on for a week until parliament started to impeach him after the de facto coup his resignation triggered wild celebrations across the country of 13 million for mugabe it was an unconstitutional and humiliating act of betrayal by his party and people and left him a broken man confined for the remaining years of his life between singapore where he was receiving medical treatment and his sprawling blue roof mansion in harare an ailing mugabe could only observe from afar the political stage where he once strode tall he was bitter to the end over the manner of his exit on the eve of the july 2018 election the first without him he told reporters he would vote for the opposition something unthinkable only a few months before educated and urbane mugabe took power in 1980 after seven years of a liberation bush war and until the armys takeover was the only leader zimbabwe formerly rhodesia knew since independence from britain but as the economy imploded starting from 2000 and his mental and physical health waned mugabe found fewer people to trust as he seemingly smoothed a path to succession for his wife grace four decades his junior and known to her critics as gucci grace for her reputed fondness for luxury shopping its the end of a very painful and sad chapter in the history of a young nation in which a dictator as he became old surrendered his court to a gang of thieves around his wife chris mutsvangwa leader of zimbabwes influential liberation war veterans told reuters after mugabes removal born on feb 21 1924 on a roman catholic mission near harare mugabe was educated by jesuit priests and worked as a primary school teacher before going to south africas university of fort hare then a breeding ground for african nationalism returning to thenrhodesia in 1960 he entered politics but was jailed for a decade four years later for opposing white rule when his infant son died of malaria in ghana in 1966 mugabe was denied parole to attend the funeral a decision by the government of whiteminority leader ian smith that historians say played a part in explaining mugabes subsequent bitterness after his release he rose to the top of the powerful zimbabwe african national liberation army known as the thinking mans guerrilla on account of his seven degrees three of them earned behind bars later as he crushed his political enemies he boasted of another qualification a degree in violence after the war ended in 1980 mugabe was elected the nations first black prime minister you have inherited a jewel in africa dont tarnish it tanzanian president julius nyerere told him during the independence celebrations in harare initially mugabe offered forgiveness and reconciliation to old foreign and domestic adversaries including smith who remained on his farm and continued to receive a government pension in his early years he presided over a booming economy spending money on roads and dams and expanding schooling for black zimbabweans as part of a wholesale dismantling of the racial discrimination of colonial days with black and white tension easing by the mid1980s many whites who had fled to britain or south africa then still under the yoke of apartheid were trying to come home but it was not long before mugabe began to suppress challengers including liberation war rival joshua nkomo faced with a revolt in the mid1980s in the western province of matabeleland that he blamed on nkomo mugabe sent in north koreantrained army units provoking an international outcry over alleged atrocities against civilians human rights groups say 20000 people died most of them from the minority ndebele tribe from which nkomos partisans were largely drawn the discovery of mass graves prompted accusations of genocide after two terms as prime minister mugabe tightened his grip on power by changing the constitution and he became president in 1987 his first wife sally who had been seen by many as the only person capable of restraining him died in 1992 a turning point came at the end of the decade when mugabe by now a leader unaccustomed to accommodating the will of the people suffered his first major defeat at the hands of voters in a referendum on another constitution he blamed his loss on the white minority chastising them as enemies of zimbabwe days later a groundswell of black anger at the slow pace of land reform started boiling over and gangs of black zimbabweans calling themselves war veterans started to overrun whiteowned farms mugabes response was uncompromising labelling the invasions a correction of colonial injustices perhaps we made a mistake by not finishing the war in the trenches he said in 2000 if the settlers had been defeated through the barrel of a gun perhaps we would not be having the same problems the farm seizures helped ruin one of africas most dynamic economies with a collapse in agricultural foreign exchange earnings unleashing hyperinflation the economy shrank by more than a third from 2000 to 2008 sending unemployment above 80 percent several million zimbabweans fled mostly to south africa brushing aside criticism mugabe portrayed himself as a radical african nationalist competing against racist and imperialist forces in washington and london the country hit rock bottom in 2008 when 500 billion percent inflation drove people to support the challenge of westernbacked former union leader morgan tsvangirai facing defeat in a presidential runoff mugabe resorted to violence forcing tsvangirai to withdraw after scores of his supporters were killed by zanupf thugs south africa zimbabwes neighbour to the south squeezed the pair into a fractious unity coalition but the compromise belied mugabes grip on power through his continued control of the army police and secret service as old age crept in and rumours of cancer intensified his animosity towards tsvangirai eased and the two men enjoyed weekly meetings over tea and scones in a nod to mugabes affection for british traditions on the eve of the 2013 election mugabe dismissed cries of autocracy and likened dealing with tsvangirai to sparring in the ring although we boxed each other its not as hostile as before he told reporters even as he spoke mugabes agents were busy finalising plans to engineer an election victory through manipulation of the voters roll according to the tsvangirai camp it was typical of mugabes ability to outthink and if necessary outfight his opponents a trait that drew grudging respect from even his sternest critics we remain committed to providing you with the

health thanks to outfits like crossfit highintensity interval training or hiit is now a household phrase before getting into the benefits of hiit and how to transform your treadmill workout heres a little background exercise intensity and energy systems are unavoidably linked you have one energy system the aerobic system which can deliver all the energy you need for minutes to hours of low to moderately highintensity activity you have other systems the anaerobic systems which kick in for those times when you need to work harder or faster and require more energy than your aerobic system can provide the drawback of these anaerobic systems is that they produce byproducts such as lactic acid that cause discomfort and with very high intensity effort ultimately accumulate to levels that prevent you from going any further at such high workloads you might think its a bad idea to work so hard that you produce substances that inhibit further exercise actually the opposite is true many of the benefits we associate with exercise correlate with very high workout intensities and correspondingly high lactic acid levels in fact maximal or nearmaximal bouts of activity lasting up to 60 seconds provide benefits that simple highintensity intervals of longer duration and submaximal effort do not especially for the amount of time spent such maximal or nearmaximal effort intervals are called sprints their benefits will tempt you to add them to your fitness and weight loss plan they include sprint intervals condition the aerobic system in less time sprint intervals from six to 60 seconds provide similar cardiorespiratory benefits to endurance or lower intensity intervals but in a fraction of the time dr izumi tabata famous for inspiring the tabata training method demonstrated that just under three minutes of time spent in sprint intervals delivered similar aerobic benefits to 60 minutes spent in moderateintensity endurance training that amounts to similar benefits in less than onetwentieth the time studies have demonstrated that the higher someones anaerobic power is developed through sprint training the better their endurance sprint intervals condition the anaerobic systems this means that you can handle really tough work for longer such as running with your bag to catch your flight or carrying your 3 year old when shes too tired to walk anaerobic fitness actually comes in handy more often than youd think sprints make you stronger and leaner its not hard to see why sprints cultivate more strength than lower intensity training sprints require speed and power and these develop strength your muscles give everything they can and quickly maximal sprints have a musclebuilding effect and encourage lean bodies in other words they burn fat this enhanced body composition results from several factors studies have found that the higher the intensity of a workout the higher the postexercise calorie burn although it only amounts to 20 to 120 calories per exercise session depending on the intensity and duration of the workout these calories add up over time and certainly play a role in longterm weight maintenance a second factor is increased fat utilization with very highintensity training you deplete your muscle glycogen stores quickly an enzyme in your muscles called ampk revs up leading to more fatty acid utilization for energy and less glucose use as your body sends the sugars back to replenish its glycogen stores other enzymes that favor fat burning over glucose also increase making your muscles glucosestoring and fatburning engines also the high levels of lactic acid that build up are associated with higher levels of testosterone and human growth hormone which stimulate fat breakdown as well a final factor and likely a large one for some individuals is the appetitesuppressing nature of very highintensity workouts studies have documented decreased appetite following exercise with the greatest decrease occurring after the highestintensity workouts sprints boost your mood exercise that demands heavy reliance on the anaerobic systems has been shown to increase circulating moodenhancing betaendorphin levels more than moderateintensity endurance exercise or intervals of less than near maximal intensity in general it appears that the higher the intensity and the higher the levels of lactic acid the greater the release of feelgood betaendorphins sprints improve brain function exercise is wellestablished as one of the key players in enhancing cognitive performance it appears that higher intensities provide more dramatic results a study that contrasted moderateintensity running with highintensity sprints concluded that the highintensity sprints were associated with significantly better shortterm learning success and intermediateterm and longterm retention of learned material making sprint interval training part of your workout routine here are a few guidelines to get you started use hills or resistance to increase the intensity this means different things for different activities if your sprint activity is walkingrunning the best way to reach the intensity you need without sprinting at max speed on a level surface is to run up hills or place your treadmill on full incline and go as fast as you can for 30 seconds to one minute this will spare your joints and tissues without sparing the intensity for a bike its the same principle hills if youre outside resistance if youre on a stationary bike swimmers already have the water acting as resistance going allout as fast as you can for 50 meters is a good swimming sprint to try for most cardio machines adding incline or resistance is a safe way to increase intensity without having to increase speed and impact to the point of high risk keep sprint intervals short and recoveries longer do 15 to 60second sprints with one to fourminute recoveries between the shorter the sprint time the shorter the recovery time between sprints aim for at least four minutes total sprint time during a workout and no more than eight minutes keep moving during the recovery cycles but with a low intensity warm up and cool down warm up for at least five minutes before performing a sprint and then do one or two high but not maximum intensity sprints before going allout and giving maximum effort after your workout cool down for another five minutes follow the workout with a few minutes of stretching do sprints once or twice a week one to two times per week of actual allout effort sprints is enough to reap the benefits give yourself at least 48 hours between these workouts on two or three other days of the week you can do some moderate intensity steadystate cardio for longer durations or some highintensity interval training do no more than three days in a week of combined hiit and sprint workouts more from youbeautycom 8 exercises that target your lower abs everyday mistakes that make you age faster 5 important habits for

environment by wynne parry livescience contributor though some reports suggest jellyfish are taking over the worlds oceans longterm records of these gelatinous animals fail to show a global increase in jellyfish blooms likely caused by pollution warming coastal development and other human influences while the analysis of a team of researchers who have pulled together records of jellyfish presence going back to the 19th century dont support a rising gelatinous menace the team did find a surprise roughly 20year cycles in the abundance of jellies part of a recent riseandfall cycle may have prompted the perception of a global swell in jellyfish according to the international team whose researchers are part of the global jellyfish group they point specifically to the rising phase that began in 1993 and peaked in 2004 blamed for stinging swimmers clogging fishing nets overrunning ecosystems and wreaking other havoc jellyfish blooms when these animals appear in massive numbers have caught the attention of the media and scientists alike a number of research papers have suggested that not only are blooms increasing on a global scale but humans are likely responsible because humans alter the oceans in ways that favor jellyfish see stunning photos of jellyfish blooms however others have maintained information on jellyfish populations just isnt sufficient to draw such conclusions this most recent study drew upon 37 datasets each of which included at least 10 years of records of jellyfish presence in an area even though the records dont evenly represent the ocean the majority came from the northern hemisphere particularly in the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea they include all available annual measurements including datasets used to support work indicating increases in jellyfish the authors write in a study published online today dec 31 in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences language has added to the challenge in common use the term jellyfish lumps together organisms that can be quite different from one another for the purposes of this study the researchers included records for true jellies the type most familiar to beachgoers their relatives the hydrozoans comb jellies which use tiny hairs called cilia to swim and another group of freeswimming invertebrates called salps from around 1940 to present the records show the 20year rising and falling cycles prior to that researchers saw signs of oscillations in regions where data were available however this isnt enough information to draw conclusions about global patterns said lead researcher rob condon a marine scientist at dauphin island sea laboratory in alabama multidecadal cycles are not uncommon in nature whether in organisms growth patterns and populations or physical phenomena such as the oxygen concentration of the oceans while the jellyfishs 20year cycle most likely has a basis in nature theres also the issue of how humans have potentially impacted the sort of natural variability that is present in many marine systems condon said and i think that is the wider part of the question that cant be answered yet from 1970 onward a weak trend toward increasing jellyfish showed up however this trend may be an artifact of the 20year cycles the authors write scientists need at least 10 more years of jellyfish records to reach any solid conclusions about the worldwide trajectory of jellyfish populations condon said adding that more data from the southern hemisphere and the open ocean are also needed the current analysis doesnt rule out the possibility of a global increase he told livescience adding that increases are most likely isolated to certain regions one region stood out in their analysis the sea of japan here records going back to the 1920s of the giant nomura jellies which grow up to 67 feet 2 meters in diameter and have been known to clog fishing nets and powerplant intakes showed an increased tendency in recent years toward extremely high numbers follow livescience on twitterlivescience were also on facebook google
health for my 10 months of treatment i was very self involved from the day i started chemo until the day i finished radiation i dont think i wanted to know anyone elses story cancer has a way of doing that each day was about how i felt how long treatment would take what food i thought i could handle who wanted to come visit the list goes on i would not have wanted to hear about someone that had been through it and was ten years down the road and having a great life i wanted to find a way to nap comfortably with a needle coming out of my chest however on those first few days after my diagnosis and those first few weeks after i finished treatment i think what i was really missing were role models until i was diagnosed i never even knew it was possible for children to get cancer i wanted to know that i could not just survive this but that i could live a long healthy life afterwards i wanted to know that my hair would in fact grow back i wanted to know that i would gain my weight and my strength back that i would arrive to my first day of high school and nobody would look at me as the cancer kid anymore i was diagnosed at age 10 with stage iv hodgkin lymphoma and i think i have learned a whole lot in my 12 years of survivorship i go through phases month to month and year to year i change my reaction to this word this extremely general word cancer in the years following treatment i went through a series of phases ecstatic to have my hair growing back getting to play basketball again becoming normal after that i developed a strong sense of survivors guilt i came to understand that there were other children with this disease that did not live through it and i began to close up i felt like if i talked about my fortunate story i was rubbing it in the face of a family that was not as lucky the next phase was empowering my parents began doing triathlons with a group called team in training and i began sharing my story at fundraisers to help raise money and develop cures for the next generation and improve conditions for those with the disease today these days my feelings change month to month sometimes i hear the cword and i am angry sometimes hopeful sometimes sad other times inspired it is a big big word that carries with it dozens of personal stories and emotions a few months into my treatment i was hospitalized for a few days in the inpatient unit i roomed with a girl named mary she liked the yankees wore an eyepatch and our moms hung out a few times when i was in treatment we didnt have cellphones let alone blogs and social media i didnt keep in touch with other patients especially in my first year of recovery when i just wanted to fit in with my peers again over a decade later i saw mary in a suit heading to the capitol building in dc and i realized what i missed when i was a patient role models i wanted to know that if i survived i would be blessed with new life values that some people dont learn well into adulthood i would understand the value of family and friends having a support system of doing things each day that make you happy but always working towards a larger goal to help the world in some way i would learn the power of someones presence you dont need to bring anything or know what to say sometimes you just need to be there cancer taught me a lot about love and loss about support about thoughtful gifts and kind words about how delicate this life we build is it may have taken me ten years to figure it all out but i am sure glad i did as i talk to my fellow survivors i truly cant believe i spent so many years disconnected from this group of my peers with such an incredible shared experience through opening up about our stories i am learning so much about this long journey of survivorship we are all on we are all to varying degrees at greater risks for secondary cancers some people have side effects you cant see like the inability to have children or extreme bouts of fatigue others were left with visible scars amputated legs prosthetic eyes yet in every interview these survivors dont dwell on the things they cant do but are grateful for all they can they are strong and inspiring people that do some extraordinary things they are the role models i wish i could have read about 12 years ago but i am happy to share their stories for children and caregivers now we remain committed

science sharks are incredibly fascinating creatures wouldnt it be cool to see what they see well researchers at the american museum of natural history have created a sharkeye camera that simulates how the shark sees underwater the impetus for this was the discovery of a group of shy sharks catsharks specifically who produce a bright green biofluorescence that does something unique says a new study published monday in scientific reports the team noticed the sharks increase the contrast of their biofluorescent glowing pattern the deeper they travel underwater the contrast makes them brighter allowing the sharks to make themselves more visible to neighbors of the same species and possibly communicate with each other weve already shown that catsharks are brightly fluorescent and this work takes that research a step further making the case that biofluorescence makes them easier to see by members of the same species john sparks a curator in the american museum of natural historys department of ichthyology and a coauthor of the study said in a statement biofluorescence is when molecules in the skin of an organism absorb the bluehued wavelengths of visible light in the water and reemit them as other colors this is not to be confused with bioluminescence which is where the light itself is produced by the organism as it is via chemical reaction in fireflies because a lot of what goes on underwater is invisible to the human eye the goingson within the biofluorescent universe arent totally known using a technique called microspectrophotometry to determine how sharks eyes absorb light the researchers discovered that sharks have long rod pigments to help them see in environments without a lot of light they used this information to develop the special camera filter that simulates how light hits a sharks eyes as study author david gruber an associate professor of biology at baruch college and a research associate at the american museum of natural history said in a statement what does all this newfound biofluorescence we are finding in the ocean mean the short answer is that theyre working on it but gruber wonders if these animals can see other animals that are biofluorescing in the deep blue sea and if so what way theyre using it the researchers recently also made the first observation of biofluorescence in marine turtles sparks said in a statement that all of these findings are a big step toward a functional explanation for fluorescence in fishes so while were not totally sure why these animals are glowing and gorgeous were certainly enjoying that they are

social jonathan lemire colleen long associated press new york ap new york city mayor bill de blasios relationship with police already strained by accusations he sided with frequent nypd critic al sharpton over the chokehold death of an unarmed suspect suffered another hit with revelations a top aide is living with a convicted killer who has often mocked officers as pigs police unions say its only the latest incident that shows the mayors lack of support for the 34000officer force and even some de blasio allies acknowledge the mayor could do a better job of leading the department he is simultaneously trying to reform this is difficult terrain particularly for a new mayor said eugene odonnell a professor of police studies at john jay college of criminal justice who was on the mayors transition team morale has been low on the force and its only getting worse following a pair of mayors who were largely lockstep with the nypd de blasio was viewed suspiciously by police from the beginning with his fierce push to end stopandfrisk the crimefighting tactic that allowed officers to stop anyone they deemed suspicious but a judge ruled sometimes discriminated against minorities he drew their ire when he called a police official to inquire about the arrest of a political ally who was later released police said the release had nothing to do with the mayors request but the unions said the call made it seem like de blasio was undermining officers and the latest strain was the revelation that rachel noerdlinger first lady chirlane mccrays chief of staff and a highly visible face at city hall is dating hassaun mcfarlan who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in a 1993 shooting when he was 15 and later served time for drug trafficking the news website dnainfo reported that mcfarlans facebook page now taken down had several posts referring to police as pigs the citys largest police union has called for noerdlingers dismissal over the matter it raises serious questions about her judgment and character and the quality of the counsel she provides to city hall said union head pat lynch although de blasio defended noerdlinger we dont care what someones boyfriend says he said the controversy shows no signs of abating it was revealed that noerdlinger recently joined mccray for a highlevel nypd crimefighting briefing while he citys department of investigations opened an investigation into whether noerdlinger failed to disclose that she lived with mcfarlan it later closed the investigation without recommending any disciplinary action but its de blasios close ties to sharpton who is also noerdlingers former boss that has fueled much of the unions anger sharpton spent months denouncing the nypd for the death of eric garner a black man who died from a police chokehold in july while being arrested for selling loose cigarettes on the street a grand jury this past week convened to consider possible charges against the white officers involved and the entire police department is being put through use of force retraining in a city hall summit called to ease tensions de blasio sat awkwardly between police commissioner william bratton and sharpton who proceeded to rail against the nypd saying the mayors teenage son who is black could also be a candidate for a chokehold police unions were outraged that sharpton was given equal billing with bratton that became a central point in a fullpage ad taken out by the sergeants benevolent association in the new york times opposing the citys bid to host the 2016 democratic national convention the mayor has provided a public platform to the loudest of the citys antisafety agitators wrote union president ed mullins the ad also claimed that city halls diminished support for police officers translates directly into crime spikes and drops in quality of life mayoral aides strongly disputed any suggestion that de blaisos leadership over the nypd had been compromised the mayor has nothing but the strongest support for the brave men and women of the nypd said spokesman phil walzak who noted crime continues to fall but experts said there are political risks for de blasio if the complaints grow louder the perception that city hall and the police are not on the same page does not usually sit well with voters said costas panagopoulos political science professor at fordham university we remain

bratton but the perception that sharpton is given an outsized voice at city hall has penetrated even the citys elite as evidenced by a roast at the annual whitetie alfred e smith dinner wednesday night what a crowd tonight home depot founder kenneth langone said looking around the ballroom at the waldorfastoria although i dont see the person in charge of the nypd up here tonight al sharpton de blasio who was sitting nearby smiled at the joke and when the dinner ended he hustled to a party for sharptons 60th birthday telling reporters the more people criticize him the more i want to hang out with him

technology juicero is a startup company that apparently wanted very much to disrupt the juice space and in pursuit of that goal its executives managed to convince silicon valley investors to pony up 120 million in seed money which has led to the production of a 400 machine that squeezes bags of juice but bloomberg technology reporters ellen huet and olivia zaleski zeroed in on an interesting fact behind all of juiceros hooplah apparently bags of juice can be squeezed by an existing product called the hand which in most instances retails for free and nearly just as often includes a buy one get one option and hands apparently squeeze these bags of juice just as well as juicero machines check it out and thus huet and zaleski have answered an important inquiry do you need a 400 juicer the answer is no but having read their story i still have so many questions lets go through bloombergs story and youll see what i mean one of the most lavishly funded gadget startups in silicon valley last year was juicero inc it makes a juice machine the product was an unlikely pick for top technology investors but they were drawn to the idea of an internetconnected device that transforms singleserving packets of chopped fruits and vegetables into a refreshing and healthy beverage why does your juicer need to be internetconnected doug evans the companys founder would compare himself with steve jobs in his pursuit of juicing perfection he declared that his juice press wields four tons of forceenough to lift two teslas he said why does anyone need that much force to squeeze juice i mean youd think that a machine that could lift just one tesla would do the trick not good enough evans told his engineers i need that second teslas worth of newtons maybe the original goal was to build a twotesla lifting machine and initial market research revealed scant demand for such a thing a person close to the company said juicero is aware the packs can be squeezed by hand but that most people would prefer to use the machine because the process is more consistent and less messy is it though heres how i get juice open fridge get juice pour into glass voila i find it hard to believe that people would prefer to use the machine also a person close to the company that person close to the company should have leveled with the company saying something like i dunno guys a 400 bag squeezer sound of sharp intake of breath the device also reads a qr code printed on the back of each produce pack and checks the source against an online database to ensure the contents havent expired or been recalled the person said the expiration date is also printed on the pack the creator of juicero is something of a luminary in the world of juicing evans 50 follows a diet of mostly raw vegan foods technology was a new thing for him but he picked it up quickly in fundraising meetings evans promised a revolutionary machine capable of squeezing large chunks of fruits and vegetables said two people who agreed to invest in the company evans secured funding in 2014 by showing 3dprinted renderings of the product without a working prototype said the people who asked not to be identified because they signed nondisclosure agreements did they also ask to not be identified because they look so foolish but after the products introduction last year at least two juicero investors were taken aback after finding the packs could be squeezed by hand wait they didnt know that bags full of juice could be squeezed by hand doug chertok a juicero investor said he figured it out on his own there is no doubt the packs can be squeezed without the machine he said im still a huge fan bububut how are you still a fan didnt they basically take your money and set it on fire he said the company is a platform for a new model of food delivery where fresh fruits and veggies are delivered regularly to the home should i be the one to break it to this guy that these kinds of services have existed for many years juicero is still figuring out its sweet spot he said i have no doubt that theyll be very successful someone just needs to build a bigger machine with the lifting force of seven teslas to help find this sweet spot no doubt but what really went wrong here its very difficult to differentiate yourself in the food and beverage sector said kurt jetta who runs retail and consumer data firm tabs analytics entrepreneurs may be tempted to have a technology angle when its not really there

health reuters health kids who have allergies at an early age are more likely than others to also have problems with anxiety and depression according to a new study as the number of allergies increase so do internalizing behavior scores the researchers found internalizing behaviors include disorders like anxiety or depression that develop when people keep their problems to themselves or internalize them i think the surprising finding for us was that allergic rhinitis has the strongest association with abnormal anxietydepressioninternalizing scores compared to other allergic diseases said lead author dr maya k nanda of the division of asthma allergy and immunology at childrens mercy hospital in kansas city missouri rhinitis includes the hay fever symptoms of runny nose sneezing and itchy watery eyes the researchers studied 546 children who had skin tests and exams at age one two three four and seven and whose parents completed behavioral assessments at age seven they looked for signs of sneezing and itchy eyes wheezing or skin inflammation related to allergies parents answered 160 questions about their childs behaviors and emotions including how often they seemed worried nervous fearful or sad kids who had allergic sneezing and itchy or watery eyes or persistent wheezing at age four tended to have higher depressive or anxiety scores than others at age seven the researchers reported in pediatrics anxiety and depression scores increased as the number of allergies increased this study cant prove causation it only describes a significant association between these disorders however we have hypotheses on why these diseases are associated nanda told reuters health by email children with allergic diseases may be at increased risk for abnormal internalizing scores due to an underlying biological mechanism or because they modify their behavior in response to the allergies she said like other chronic diseases allergic diseases may trigger maladaptive behaviors or emotions she said but some prior studies support a biologic mechanism that involves allergy antibodies triggering production of other substances that affect parts of the brain that control emotions earlier studies have found links between allergies and anxiety disorders such as panic attacks or generalized anxiety disorders nanda said the new study took race gender and other factors into account so the strong association between allergic disease and internalizing disorder we found is definitely present she said the severity of mental health symptoms varied in this study some children had anxiety and depression that needs treatment while others were at risk and required monitoring she said we think this study calls for better screening by pediatricians allergists and parents of children with allergic disease she said too often in my clinic i see allergic children with clinical anxiety or depressive symptoms however they are receiving no care for these conditions we dont know how treatment for allergic diseases may effect or change the risk for internalizing disorders and we hope to study this in the future nanda said source httpbitly1ymljrb pediatrics online december 29 2015

environment spent reactor fuel containing roughly 85 times more longlived radioactivity than released at chernobyl still sits in pools vulnerable to earthquakes more than a year after the fukushima nuclear power disaster began the news media is just beginning to grasp that the dangers to japan and the rest of the world are far from over after repeated warnings by former senior japanese officials nuclear experts and now a us senator its sinking in that the irradiated nuclear fuel stored in spent fuel pools amidst the reactor ruins pose far greater dangers than the molten cores this is why nearly all of the 10893 spent fuel assemblies sit in pools vulnerable to future earthquakes with roughly 85 times more longlived radioactivity than released at chernobyl several pools are 100 feet above the ground and are completely open to the atmosphere because the reactor buildings were demolished by explosions the pools could possibly topple or collapse from structural damage coupled with another powerful earthquake the loss of water exposing the spent fuel will result in overheating and can cause melting and ignite its zirconium metal cladding resulting in a fire that could deposit large amounts of radioactive materials over hundreds if not thousands of miles this was not lost on senator ron wyden dor who after visiting the site on april 6 wrote to japans us ambassador ichiro fujusaki that loss of containment in any of these pools could result an even larger release of radiation than the nuclear accident the urgency of the situation is underscored by the ongoing seismic activity where 13 earthquakes of magnitude 4057 have occurred off the northeast coast of japan between april 14 and 17 this has been the norm since the first quake and tsunami hit the daiichi site on march 11 of last year larger quakes are expected closer to the power plant spent nuclear fuel is extraordinarily radioactive and must be handled with great care in a matter of seconds an unprotected person one foot away from a single freshly removed spent fuel assembly would receive a lethal dose of radiation within seconds as one of the most dangerous materials on the planet spent reactor fuel requires permanent geological isolation to protect humans for thousands of years its been 26 years since the chernobyl reactor exploded and caught fire releasing enormous amounts of radioactive debris seriously contaminating areas over a thousand miles away chernobyl revealed the folly of not having an extra barrier of thick concrete and steel surrounding the reactor core that is required for modern plants in the us japan and elsewhere the fukushima daiichi accident revealed the folly of operating several nuclear power plants in a high consequence earthquake zone while storing huge amounts of highly radioactive spent fuel in vulnerable pools high above the ground what both accidents have in common is widespread environmental contamination from cesium137 with a halflife of 30 years cs137 gives off penetrating radiation as it decays and can remain dangerous for hundreds of years once in the environment it mimics potassium as it accumulates in the food chain when it enters the human body about 75 percent lodges in muscle tissue with perhaps the most important muscle being the heart last week tokyo electric power company tepco revealed plans to remove 2274 spent fuel assemblies from the damaged reactors that will probably take at least a decade to accomplish the first priority will be removal of the contents in pool no 4 this pool is structurally damaged and contains about 10 times more cesium137 than released at chernobyl removal of snf from the no 4 reactor is optimistically expected to begin at the end of 2013 a significant amount of construction to remove debris and reinforce the structurallydamaged reactor buildings especially the fuel handling areas will be required also it is not safe to keep 1882 spent fuel assemblies containing 57 million curies of longlived radioactivity including nearly 15 times more cs137 than released at chernobyl in the elevated pools at reactors 5 6 and 7 which did not experience meltdowns and explosions the main reason why there is so much spent fuel at the daichi site is that the plan to send it off for nuclear recycling has collapsed it was supposed to go to the incomplete rokkasho reprocessing plant just south of the fukushima nuclear site where plutonium would be extracted as a fuel for fast reactors this scheme is based on long discredited assumptions that world uranium supplies would be rapidly exhausted and that a new generation of fast reactors which held the promise of making more fuel than they use would be needed over the past 20 years the rokkashos costs have tripled along with 18 major delays world uranium supplies are far from depleted moreover in november of last year japans fast reactor project at monju was cancelled for cost and safety reasons dealing a major blow to this whole scheme we

tepcos plan is realized is that nearly all of the spent fuel at the daichi containing some of the largest concentrations of radioactivity on the planet will remain indefinitely in vulnerable pools tepco wants to store the spent fuel from the damaged reactors in the common pool and only to resort to dry cask storage when the common pools capacity is exceeded at this time the common pool is at 80 percent storage capacity and will require removal of snf to make room tepcos plan is to minimize dry cask storage as much as possible and to rely indefinitely on vulnerable pool storage sen wyden finds that that tepcos plan for remediation carries extraordinary and continuing risk and sensibly recommends that retrieval of spent fuel in existing onsite spent fuel pools to safer storage in dry casks should be a priority despite the enormous destruction from the earthquake and tsunami little attention was paid to the fact that the nine dry spent fuel casks at the fukushima daichi site were unscathed this is an important lesson we cannot afford to ignore

economy a breakup doubled andrea guinns living expenses overnight saddled with the bills and rent for the apartment she once shared with her ex in queens she fell behind on payments to consolidated edison the 29 billion investorowned utility that enjoys a monopoly on electricity in new york city by february the 33yearold said she paid off all but 74 of the nearly 600 she owed the utility and stayed current on her monthly bills but one night last month she came home and discovered con edison had cut her power off anyway she charged her dead phone on a nearly drained laptop battery and called the company demanding it turn the power back on after failing to give proper notice staying awake by candlelight she finally reached an operator at 1 am the utility restored electricity the next day so as the coronavirus outbreak cascaded into a fullblown economic and public health crisis this week guinn was relieved when new york regulators said friday that electrical and gas utilities across the state had agreed to stop disconnecting services for nonpayment it shouldnt take a pandemic for people to realize that energy should be a right said guinn 33 who works in manhattan as a graphic designer even briefly having that interrupted made me realize how precarious our system is its terrifying by friday evening regulators in at least eight states and five cities had directed utilities to maintain connections to ratepayers struggling to keep up with bills as officials urged americans to stay home to avoid spreading covid19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus nearly 50 more companies voluntarily pledged to postpone shutoffs according to a survey by a watchdog group the illness which the world health organization declared a global pandemic on wednesday and its economic fallout have paid borders no heed spreading to at least 123 countries with confirmed cases in nearly every state and puerto rico yet not every american could count on uninterrupted light heat or water service nearly a dozen more utilities including some that operate monopolies in major markets either announced no such plans or vowed to continue service terminations with at least one going as far as to email indebted customers a collections reminder on friday the disparity exposed what advocates say is a hole in the legal framework that governs when utilities are allowed to cut off services considered basic modern necessities during crises in states such as ohio new york and new jersey state regulators said all major utilities volunteered to pause shutoffs the investorowned arizona public service the largest electricity provider in the southwestern state told the phoenix new times it suspended customer disconnects for all nonpayment for the immediate future pacific gas electric co the troubled utility responsible for californias most destructive wildfire in modern history issued a press release vowing to stop all disconnects until further notice the announcements came under mounting pressure from public officials seeking relief for workers facing layoffs or reduced income as the economy slowed and federal lawmakers debated the merits of basic employee protections such as paid sick leave its such a cruel way of thinking worrying that someone is trying to take advantage of a moment of crisis to not pay their bills utilities refused to provide such relief florida power light one of the states largest utility monopolies sent its millions of customers an email about its preparedness for the pandemic but directed those experiencing hardship as a result of covid19 to a webpage offering payment plans and online billing in arizona salt river project a public agency that sells electricity declined to suspend disconnections instead agreeing to make every effort to work with our customers to avoid disconnections it told the new times in new orleans city council members pressed entergy corp the nearly 21 billion company that provides the citys power to suspend shutoffs as the national crisis rapidly worsened thursday that is something were considering brian guillot entergy new orleans vice president of regulatory affairs told councilwoman helena moreno according to a report in the lens i would ask for that answer to come today replied moreno who as utility chair is one of the few city council members in the country to directly oversee a power company which usually falls under state jurisdiction we really would expect the answer to be yes later that day the company sent a letter to the council agreeing to temporarily suspend disconnecting only some customers for the next 30 days when nonpayment is the result of the covid19 virus we will continue to monitor the situation and extend if necessary read the letter signed by entergy new orleans ceo david ellis the company told huffpost the policy only applied to new orleans at the moment as it waited for directions from state agencies corporate spokesman neal kirby said the new orleans division was still determining how to assess whether nonpayment was the result of coronavirus but claimed there were no shutoffs this week enforcing specific criteria could prove difficult and amounts to a dangerous hedging said david pomerantz executive director of the energy and policy institute a utility watchdog if someone gets laid off or furloughed or theyre a smallbusiness owner who has less money coming in and was already living paycheck to paycheck is entergy really going to ask for receipts here he said by phone its such a cruel way of thinking worrying that someone is trying to take advantage of a moment of crisis to not pay their bills his san franciscobased nonprofit is running an informal survey to determine which utilities are continuing to halt services and why and posted the findings here the fact that so many utilities curtailed shutoffs voluntarily as opposed to waiting for orders from regulators highlights the lack of legal protections requiring companies to maintain services during a pandemic he said most states bar utilities from shutting off power or gas if temperatures are below 32 degrees fahrenheit or above 95 degrees but the offering of this protection varies by state according to a 2017 report from the naacp yet nine states alaska california colorado connecticut florida north dakota oregon tennessee and virginia do not provide any stateregulated seasonal protections the report found the report which described the need to reform shutoff policy as a human rights matter made no mention of pandemics but noted that exposure to extreme temperatures risked causing illness the edison electric institute an industryfunded trade group for utilities outlined a very basic guide to planning for a pandemic urging member companies to conduct new training review policies on hygiene and sanitation and communicate with workers regulators and other stakeholders but the eightpage memo made no mention of shutoffs though a spokesman for the group said the document was meant to explain to the public the steps companies take to prepare for a pandemic once there is one they consider things like disconnects often in consultation with their regulators electric companies across the country are working with their communities and their regulators to identify ways to assist customers during this health emergency brian reil the spokesperson wrote in an email the panic over the coronavirus could spur the decentralized but growing campaigns in many cities and states including new york and california to bring investorowned utilities under government control austin energy the cityowned power company in the texas capital announced its moratorium on shutoffs a day after its city council

join us once again regardless of ownership model if the utility is not suspending disconnects then id expect them to have a lot of political problems immediately pomerantz said and they would deserve those problems the public power movement is largely predicated on the idea that a publicly owned utility can be transitioned off fossil fuels faster than a private company a premise that climate policy experts debate but the trump administrations bungled response to the covid19 outbreak demonstrated the threat of an ideological overreliance on the private sector to solve a global crisis and could fuel calls for more public control over utilities when a state or federal agency declares a state of emergency the oversight is so much stronger than having to rely on pressure on private utilities that are still about making profits for shareholders rather than providing in a time of crisis said aaron eisenberg a campaigner with the new york chapter of democratic socialists of america which is pushing for the public takeover of con edison this crisis showcases the public power argument
environment word problem answers graded on a curve a 1981 dodge ram van faded brown with those funky round portholes in the back leaves the town of winkelman at 45 miles an hour pulling 2500 pounds in an unregistered trailer a 2012 nissan leaf silver with a be kind bumper sticker departs tucson at 72 miles an hour carrying an ipad 3 and a frappuccino which is greener beats me all i know is i see them both on the road to the ranch and each carries an intriguing backstory the van is hauling twentyfive hundred pounds of rusty twisted scrap metal thats been scrounged from a desert wash somewhere looks like maybe a studebaker panel and some old irrigation pipe i know where hes headed to the scrap yard rumor has it that scrap recyclers are now paying 160 a ton for anything you can drag in old freezers wrecked cars barbed wire you name it theyll buy it pitiful gleanings of societys underclass perhaps more charitably and accurately you might call it the largest voluntary regional recycling program in modern history in the last ten years according to the steel alliance more than a trillion pounds of steel have been recycled a trillion pounds for reference thats roughly the combined weight of all the humans on earth how amazing is that no mandates no administration no forms no fines no fuss just a steady stream of metal into the decentralized workings of an international system of material reuse would a concerted program to clean up the desert have been remotely as effective as this spontaneous outpouring of enthusiasm for bent and abandoned debris the building boom in china pushing up steel prices is forcing me to call the cops on scrappy entrepreneurs nicking used hot water heaters how cool let us compare this to another spirited civil campaign like the vaguely disturbing monolith scene from 2001 a space odyssey four sleek columns appeared at the corner of elm and mabel one day they are electriccar charging stations part of a network of 180 residential and 230 public monuments to tucsons environmental ethos made by ecotality under the brand blink they would normally run 3000 each and another two to three thousand to install these were free and thank goodness because ive never seen a car plugged into the things since they appeared like mushrooms in january i say free because the company helpfully offers the units free of charge ahem and provides a 1200 installation credit to boot selfsacrificing public service by a greenminded company perhaps more accurately and less charitably you might call it fleecing the company is relying on a 1148 million grant from the department of energy that means every incometax paying citizen chipped in a buck to help this company develop infrastructure ill warrant a modest profit besides who knows maybe this is money better spent than the equivalent purchase of five and a half new fa18s or buying 33 million gallons of gas for poor people or paying the healthcare costs of 14000 souls or whatever maybe we taxpayers gain inner peace knowing that four unused electrical totems are at least sending the right message i know that our family is personally getting its moneys worth our 4 and 5 yearolds enjoy the touchscreens and making the nifty lights blink one of the units and i trust this is unrelated needs replacing after never being used am i being snarky here why dont i get it on the one hand we have a vibrant unprompted industry that caters to the worlds desire for metal cleans the environment lessens the need for additional mining and creates livelihoods for people needing work on the other we have highly centralized corporate welfare which picks winners to provide expensive coalfired electric charging service to people who dont want it what am i missing i mean i get it that electric gizmos are sexier than their dieselpowered cousins and all that who would want to drive the ateam van when you could drive something shiny and shaped like a computer mouse but surely were going to base spending on more than just looks right right maybe its the environmental benefit i dont have the time personally to do a full lifecycle analysis but according to british studies electric cars have a slightly higher carbon footprint than their petrol counterparts battery production is extraordinarily carbonintensive and electric power is overwhelmingly fossilbased then again other studies show a slightly lower footprint after about 80000 miles of driving so after your third roadtrip around the equator your karmacarbon account starts nudging into the green whatever the truth is clean

worldnews bogota colombia ap as women in the united states find themselves on the verge of possibly losing the constitutional right to abortion courts in many other parts of the world have been moving in the opposite direction that includes in a number of traditionally conservative societies such as recently in colombia where the constitutional court in february legalized the procedure until the 24th week of pregnancy part of a broader trend seen in parts of heavily catholic latin america its not yet clear what impact there will be outside the united states from the leaked draft opinion suggesting the us supreme court could overturn the landmark 1973 roe v wade decision but for womens activists who for years have led grinding campaigns demanding open access to abortion often looking to the united states as a model its a discouraging sign and a reminder that hardwon gains can be impermanent it is an awful precedent for the coming years for the region and the world said colombian catalina martnez coral latin america and caribbean director for the new yorkbased center for reproductive rights which was among the groups that litigated the abortion case in colombias high court the february ruling there established a broad right for women to have abortions within the 24week period whereas previously they could do so only in specific cases such as if a fetus presented malformations or a pregnancy resulted from rape abortion is still allowed after that period under those special circumstances the decision fell short of advocates hopes for a complete decriminalization but martnez coral said it still left colombia with the most progressive legal framework in latin america similarly mexicos supreme court held last year that it was unconstitutional to punish abortion as the countrys highest court its ruling bars all jurisdictions from charging a woman with a crime for terminating a pregnancy statutes outlawing abortion are still on the books in most of mexicos 32 states however and nongovernmental organizations that have long pushed for decriminalization are pressing state legislatures to reform them abortion was already readily available in mexico city and some states to the south in argentina lawmakers in late 2020 passed a bill legalizing abortion until the 14th week and after that for circumstances similar to those described in the colombia ruling its also widely available in cuba and uruguay but expansion of abortion access has not extended to all of latin america with many countries restricting it to certain circumstances such as brazil the regions most populous nation where its permissible only in cases of rape risk to the womans life and certified cases of the birth defect anencephaly former president luiz incio lula da silva who is seeking a new term in october recently said he sees legalizing abortion as a public health issue eliciting criticism in a country where few approve of the procedure other places have total bans with no exceptions such as honduras nicaragua and el salvador courts in the latter have given women long prison sentences for aggravated homicide even in cases where prosecutors suspect a miscarriage was actually an abortion many african nations also maintain complete bans but in october 2021 benin legalized abortion in most circumstances up to 12 weeks that significantly increased safe access to the procedure after the health minister reported that nearly 200 women were dying each year of complications from clandestine abortions previously abortion was permitted in cases of rape or incest risk to the womans life or severe fetal malformation most european countries have legalized abortion including predominantly catholic ones ireland did so in 2018 followed by tiny san marino in a voter referendum last fall it remains illegal in andorra malta and vatican city while poland last year tightened its abortion laws its also been widely available in israel since 1978 and relatively uncontroversial allowed by law before the 24th week with the approval of hospital termination committees that consist of medical professionals including at least one woman laws and interpretations vary across the muslim world abortion has been legal up to 12 weeks in tunisia for decades but in iran its been forbidden since the 1979 islamic revolution last year the leader of cairos top institution of islamic clerics alazhar said abortion is not the solution even in cases where a child is likely to be seriously ill or disabled in japan abortion is allowed only for economic and health reasons and requires partners consent making japan one of a handful of countries in the world to do so victims of sexual violence are excluded from the requirement while there is a growing call for women to have the right to make their own decision japans government led by the ultraconservative liberal democratic party has long focused on traditional gender roles of women to give birth and raise children japan has not approved abortion pills though an application for one by a british company is pending at the health ministry abortion has been legal in india since 1971 women can terminate pregnancy up to 20 weeks but only on a doctors advice under changes in 2021 a woman can also seek an abortion up to 24 weeks under certain circumstances such as rape or incest though it requires approval from two doctors china is moving to limit abortions but thats because it has one of the highest rates of abortions in the world last september the chinese cabinet known as the state council published new national guidelines that require hospitals to reduce nonmedically necessary abortions in february chinas family planning association announced it would launch a campaign to reduce teenage abortions when the us supreme courts final decision is handed down expected in late june or early july the world will be watching while moves to decriminalize and legalize abortion in places like argentina ireland mexico and colombia in the last few years have been a huge win for the global community agnes callamard secretarygeneral of the human rights group amnesty international

politics a new bipartisan bill to give afghans in america a pathway to permanent residency stands a slim chance of winning enough republican support to become law in the near future the us brought in tens of thousands of people as part of its hasty retreat from afghanistan last year but has not said that they can stay the afghan adjustment act introduced in august by sen amy klobuchar dminn with three republican cosponsors would create a path to permanent residency for more than 77000 afghans who have arrived in the us since last summer giving our afghan allies many of whom worked alongside our us military a chance to apply for permanent legal status is the right and necessary thing to do klobuchar told huffpost in a statement this bipartisan legislation will provide afghans who submit to additional vetting a green card to live and work in the united states the bill would also expand eligibility for socalled special immigrant visas to other atrisk groups still in afghanistan such as certain former members of the afghan armed forces these people have no place to go bill cosponsor sen lindsey graham rsc told huffpost their country has fallen into hell but graham acknowledged that it would be difficult to win over enough republicans to get the bill through the senate saying his colleagues have a legitimate concern that afghan nationals could pose a security risk sen rick scott rfla for instance argued that president joe bidens administration failed to vet the 80000 afghans admitted to the us last year a defense department report from february said its records on 50 afghan evacuees indicated potentially significant security concerns i think we need to start by finding out whos here and what their background is and making sure people around the country know where these people went to scott told huffpost as novembers midterm elections approach republicans have been more hostile toward immigrants in general with some describing them as invaders pouring through an insecure southern border gop governors have even sent buses and planes full of migrants to democraticled cities as a political stunt in august 2021 the biden administration used a measure known as humanitarian parole to allow afghans to enter the us for a twoyear period officials ran evacuees fingerprints and records through criminal and terrorism databases at military installations in europe and the middle east parole is not recognized as an immigration status and it offers no road to permanent residency the main options for afghans are asylum and special immigrant status but these can be complicated and costly to attain the biden administration announced in march that afghans would be eligible for temporary protected status preventing them from having to return to unsafe conditions but tps does not guarantee permanent residency advocates of the afghan adjustment act who point to the fact that afghans in the us could lose eligibility for humanitarian parole or temporary protected status next year and potentially face deportation are optimistic about the bills prospects even if we run out of time this month we have other opportunities to get this done said chris purdy the director of veterans for american ideals and outreach at the nonprofit human rights first passing this bill is a major priority for members in both houses and every time weve brought this to congress weve gotten more and more supporters passage of the afghan adjustment act is not a matter of if its a matter of when there has been less violence in afghanistan since the us finished its withdrawal last summer but the ruling taliban reportedly still target former members of the military and government officials despite a declared amnesty the government is accused of persecuting minority groups and imprisoning and torturing journalists while women face restrictive new laws the country is also experiencing an economic crisis which is primarily the result of frozen assets in the united states as well as other factors such as drought still the near future is unlikely to see a critical mass of support for protecting afghan evacuees and republicans could take control of one or both chambers of congress next year which would make this even more difficult i just wish we could all agree conceptually that the people who are here have no place to go back and they were involved in a war that we were involved in for 20 years and how we treat them will say a lot about how people will fight with us in the future graham said on thursday a small number of supporters rallied for the bill outside of congress many of those we are advocating for if not all have made the ultimate sacrifice by putting their lives in danger protecting democracy and helping our men and women in uniform jawaid kotwal an afghan american told huffpost so we owe it to them we did it in the past for vietnamese and kurds so its the moral responsibility of the us government to protect these people and those who have already made it to give them a pathway and road map towards citizenship
health update october 18 2018 late monday alyssa milano tweeted again calling attention to activist tarana burke the founder of girls for gender equity and woman who is credited with beginning the me too movement over a decade ago milano simply renewed the call to action this past sunday according to cnn burke began the movement after hearing about a young girls sexual assault by her mothers boyfriend this piece was originally published on october 16 2017 on sunday afternoon actress alyssa milano kicked off what is sure to go down in record books one of the most powerful social activism hashtags this year milano posted a tweet encouraging those who have experienced sexual harassment and abuse to reply me too to raise awareness of the problems vastness the hashtag took off and what has resulted is a movement spanning social media sites with people sharing their own stories and expressing solidarity with survivors if youve been sexually harassed or assaulted write me too as a reply to this tweet pictwittercomk2oeciuf9n milanos me too is the second hashtag geared towards issues of sexual harassment and abuse which has largely been the result of the allegations against harvey weinstein to go viral within a week on friday rose mcgowans womenboycotttwitter took hold but was largely limited to twitter and media coverage twitter ceo jack dorsey responded to the boycott late that night saying that twitter will enforce new rules around violent groups unwanted sexual advances and hate symbols among others by comparison milanos me too has proven more effective her message is reverberating across twitter instagram and facebook with women echoing her sentiment in ways that are unique to each platform its easy to see why me too has more widespread appeal although many women agreed with mcgowans larger point that no woman should be silenced online for expressing her beliefs about the sensitive issues at hand some were against the idea of signing off of twitter as a result womenboycotttwitter was as divisive as it was unifying me too on the other hand offers the opportunity for everyone to join in the conversation however they see fit the phrase is just specific enough that no other words are needed but still vague enough to serve as a starting point from which survivors can tell their stories on instagram many are choosing to post photos with the words me too against a black or colored background allowing the words to speak for themselves the hashtag has been used in over 325600 posts thus far shannon downey the selfnamed craftiest whose boys will be boys post went viral last week has posted her own crossstitched take on the saying a post shared by shannon downey badasscrossstitch on oct 16 2017 at 512am pdt a smaller number are representing themselves and their experiences with a selfie or portrait accompanied by their experiences of sexual harassment and abuse a post shared by apoorva jayarajan apoorvajayarajan on oct 16 2017 at 326am pdt on facebook the types of posts vary to an even wider extent a few women and men are reposting milanos words verbatim but more are making use of the over 140character word count to tell their own in depth personal stories in a format that resembles a diary post within 24 hours 47 million people around the world engaged in the me too conversation on facebook with over 12 million posts comments and reactions according to facebook more than 45 percent of people in the us are friends with someone who has posted me too and on twitter where the movement began over 38000 people have replied to milanos original post and 14000 have retweeted it according to a twitter spokesperson metoo has been tweeted nearly half a million times in the past 24 hours users are posting stats about sexual assault brief messages about the man who and in some cases embedding their posts from facebook or notes in order to tell longer tales of their experiences regarding boys and men as rape

worldnews a few days after the election that elevated donald trump to the us presidency the german magazine der spiegel ran an image on its cover of trumps head a blaze of yellow and orange hurtling through dark space toward the globe above the headline the end of the world in the year since the nov 8 2016 election dread and anxiety around the world has only mounted with the realization that trump doesnt care for strategic alliances or multilateral solutions to global challenges his is a zerosum approach to world affairs in which the winner takes all and diplomacy is for losers the united states has become less respected under trump polls suggest and as the president disdainfully discards the nations mantle of global leadership erstwhile close allies are relying less on america and instead are going their own way the new derspiegel cover story on trumps election will be online in english this evening european time pictwittercomoknypxzgtd trumps management of us foreign policy is revolutionary in a very negative way said aaron david miller who is vice president and middle east programs director at the woodrow wilson international center and a former state department negotiator in past democratic and republican administrations its a galactic disaster trump has disempowered secretary of state rex tillerson by farming out foreign policy to his soninlaw and chief adviser jared kushner and to gary cohn the head of the national economic council and trumps chief economic adviser hes also allowed us ambassador to the un nikki haley to speak on issues that normally fall under the purview of the secretary of state miller said adding that trump also contradicts himself his advisers and members of his cabinet messaging has been wandering all over the parking lot miller said the rest of the world is shaking its head he added theyve lost a good bit of faith in american leadership and what america stands for trumps pugnacious style and his manichean rhetoric on the world stage along with the unpredictability of a white house in nearconstant disarray and the abandonment of several existing international commitments have only further eroded americas position trump has withdrawn from the paris climate accords and the transpacific partnership trade agreement he has threatened to walk away from the iran nuclear deal angering european allies who see america going back on its word he has vowed to build a wall on the usmexico border and pull out of the north american free trade agreement he has left key state department positions unfilled impairing americas ability to understand the rest of the world and his blustery rhetoric on north korea has raised fears of nuclear war its the worst of all worlds said stephen m walt professor of international affairs at harvard universitys john f kennedy school of government the united states is continuing to intervene in various places but were now doing it with an incompetent president and this will not end well the biggest difference between trump and his predecessors walt argued is trumps seeming disregard for foundational american values such as freedom democracy and equal rights that combined with ease around thuggish authoritarian presidents including vladimir putin in russia and rodrigo duterte in the philippines directly undermine americas standing in the world hes very comfortable with dictators of all kinds walt said its one thing to recognize that there are sometimes tradeoffs and that sometimes you have to compromise on those values but in trumps case hes throwing those values out of the window and that is giving up a great advantage that the united states has had in terms of foreign policy namely that the united states stood for something other than just selfinterest trump and many of his key policies are broadly unpopular around the globe and ratings for the us have declined steeply in many nations according to the pew research center which polled more than 40000 people from 37 countries around the world earlier this year most nonamericans consider trump arrogant intolerant and even dangerous the poll found just 22 percent of respondents expressed confidence in trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs compared with 64 percent during barack obamas presidency the decline in trust was most marked among americas closest allies in europe and asia as well as in neighboring mexico and canada in only two of the polled countries russia and israel did people believe trump is a better president than obama i dont think you need a pew poll to come to the conclusion that our allies are beside themselves both in terms of the issue of competency and strategy and our adversaries have exploited every conceivable opportunity trump has thrown their way said miller american presidents once heralded the country as the shining city on a hill an exceptional beacon to the rest of the world and allies saw the appeal in making common cause with the us with british leaders often boasting of the special relationship that spanned the atlantic these days apprehension about the us has even crept into the halls of westminster america first doesnt sound like the basis for a mutually beneficial partnership one tory member of parliament told huffpost on condition of anonymity after the us election european liberals feared a wave of trumpstyle populism that would upend the political map on the continent and bring down the postworld war ii political order but when dutch voters went to the polls in march they rejected the nativist populism embodied by geert wilders a farright leader who had praised trump throughout his campaign the trump factor played a role in making people think twice about voting for a populist as people have seen that if you elect a populist you can get all kinds of wacky policies charles grant director of the center for european reform a londonbased research organization told the new york times in france emmanuel macron won the spring elections in a landslide by shrewdly positioning himself as the antitrump a liberal progressive globalist believer in diplomacy and international institutions when trump announced his decision to withdraw from the paris climate deal macron tweeted make our planet great again earning 230000 retweets and sparking a french governmentfunded website by that name that encourages those concerned about climate change especially scientists and entrepreneurs to immigrate to france trump is so disliked in france that the label trump la franaise has become a mark of political infamy and former allies such as the farright national front leader marine le pen rarely invoke his name even farright voters dont like trump anymore supporters of the national front a populist antiimmigrant party hold increasingly negative views of trump according to a new poll by huffpost france only around 20 percent of national front voters say they have a positive opinion of trump a decline of 11 percent since a similar poll from last year suggesting that familiarity has bred dislike given the intense disregard of trump european leaders have by and large sought to distance themselves from the american president lest they be tainted by association in germany chancellor angela merkels party made one small but significant change to its electoral program before national elections earlier this year substituting the word friend with the word partner when referring to the us that puts america in the same category as turkey a country with which germany has strained relations we remain

theresa may waded into political trouble when she invited trump for a state visit soon after his inauguration formally invitations for state visits have to be extended by the queen on advice from her government and more than 18 million people signed an online petition to have the visit downgraded because trump would cause embarrassment to her majesty the speaker of the house of commons also refused to allow trump the honor of addressing the westminster parliament citing trumps racism and sexism for now the visit appears to be postponed until sometime next year lennart pfahler paul waugh

away or tax the rich the committee was taking public comment on the proposed progressive tax on business a fee on seattles largest corporations to support homeless services last week amazon the employer of more than 45000 seattleites that is on the hook for an estimated 20 million under the tax announced it was pausing construction planning on a tower downtown and would consider renting some of its office space to other companies if the fee goes through now the mayor and city council have to decide whether to take this threat seriously about a third of the attendees at wednesdays hearing were wearing construction vests one of them told committee members that if the tax passes workers will have to go home look their kids in the eye and tell them daddy doesnt have a job anymore another called a member of the city council a communist shes actually a socialist and said she seems to be getting paid by the residents of seattle to throw temper tantrums but the fight is about more than just one company or one policy it is about the growing challenge of running american cities and all the ways companies make it even harder seattle faces an impossible choice either raise revenue from employers and risk driving them away or keep levying taxes on voters and risk a backlash that could exacerbate the very problem its trying to solve whatever happens here it will be a template for the rest of the country the details of seattles proposed tax are crucial to understanding why amazon hates it so much under the current proposal the city will charge large companies 26 cents for every hour their employees work thats about 520 per worker every year though the tax will apply only to companies with more than 20 million in revenue per year or about 3 percent of seattle businesses amazon employs about 145000 people and that structure is only temporary the tax is flat for the first three years the same fee is levied on wages whether an employee earns 31200 a year the minimum wage here or more than 100000 what many amazon corporate employees make but in 2021 the flat fee becomes a payroll tax large companies will have to pay 07 percent of their employees wages thats 220 per year for minimum wage workers and more than 700 for amazons corporate employees its the second part bigger taxes for bigger incomes that seems to worry the companies here a few days after amazons announcement the ceo of seattlebased zillow made the same takingourballandgoinghome threat calling the tax misguided and too blunt of an instrument but you cant talk about where the money comes from without talking about where its going homelessness is an emergency in seattle literally in 2015 the mayor issued an emergency proclamation over the sheer number of people sleeping outside and in their cars and overflowing from shelters at last count seattle had 11643 homeless people and its home of king county had the thirdhighest homeless concentration in the nation a study last year by zillow estimated that every 5 percent rise in seattle rents pushed 258 more people into homelessness rents here rose 135 percent last year alone the proposed tax would raise about 75 million per year to help address this crisis bringing the citys total homelessness budget up to 200 million threequarters of the revenue would go toward building affordable housing and a smaller chunk would go toward direct immediate services things like temporary shelters hygiene centers and shelter beds this isnt about amazon said lisa herbold a seattle city council member and a cosponsor of the tax its about the humanitarian crisis in our city its clear that seattles tax is going to piss off amazon the question is how much everything the company has said so far has been pretty tepid amazon has not in fact stopped construction on any downtown towers it has stopped planning future construction a much different and less costly decision similarly the company announced it was exploring the option of subleasing some floors in one of its alreadyunderconstruction office buildings that doesnt mean amazon is crying wolf but it does mean theres still a lot of uncertainty about the companys response even if members of the seattle city council approve the tax hell even if they triple it washington is still a relatively cheap place to do business it has no income tax which is effectively a pay raise for amazon employees who move here from elsewhere no capital gains tax and no corporate income tax the city even passed an almost identical tax on employees albeit at a much lower rate in 2006 before repealing it during the recession then theres the public relations aspect to consider though it will grow after 2021 amazons tax bill under the law will be pocket change compared with its 16 billion in profits last quarter alone moving employees halting construction and reversing course all have costs too plus does a notsuperpopular corporate behemoth really want to pull thousands of jobs out of a city over being asked to fund services for the homeless while amazon is less reputationconscious and less likely to be harmed by a boycott than a lot of companies are its executives must know that throwing a hissy fit over this law would create some backlash amazon could still pull jobs out of seattle anyway the only thing ceo jeff bezos loves more than expanding his company is hating taxes when a handful of states tried passing laws requiring internet retailers to collect sales tax in 2012 his vice president for global public policy called the efforts unconstitutional a few years ago amazon halted plans to build a warehouse in south carolina when local lawmakers wouldnt grant an exemption to the state sales tax bezos even reportedly considered incorporating his company on a native american reservation to avoid taxes just because leaving seattle over a small tax increase would be bananas doesnt mean it wont happen in the past five years seattle has seen unprecedented growth much of it driven by amazon and other large companies that has put unbearable strain on the housing market schools and infrastructure as the bill for services has grown the way the city pays for them has become increasingly unjust washington has the most regressive tax structure in the country the poorest 20 percent of residents pay an average of 168 percent of their income in state taxes the richest 1 percent pay just 24 percent this means lowincome people are effectively paying for the citys growth and yet nearly every route to fixing seattles tax and revenue mess is blocked the most obvious fix an income tax is illegal under the state constitution or at least the way the state supreme court interpreted the constitution in 1951 last year the city council passed a high earners tax but a lawsuit preventing its implementation was filed about 10 minutes later alongside the high and regressive sales tax seattle relies heavily on property taxes but thanks to a 2001 ballot initiative those revenues arent allowed to grow by more than 1 percent per year everything the city needs libraries fire stations schools has to be individually approved by voters though seattles property taxes are below average compared with other cities the constant levies and addons contribute to a sense among seattleites that the city is squeezing them for more money every year without keeping up its end of the bargain homelessness is the perfect encapsulation of this dynamic as the city has grown its nearly doubled its budget for homeless services in 2016 voters approved a 290 million affordable housing levy the city is getting more people into permanent housing than ever before but living here it is immediately and viscerally clear that these efforts arent enough rising rents are pushing people onto the streets faster than the city can bring them back inside nearly half of the citys homeless population is now unsheltered last year a record 169 people died sleeping on the street and the city is already on track to break the record again seattles current situation exposes a fundamental challenge for lawmakers across the country solving big problems requires bold transformational policies what city leaders can pass in the face of structural barriers and skeptical voters however are merely small incremental improvements to the status quo and thats exactly what the progressive tax on business is a halfmeasure no matter what amazon decides to do taxing employment just like taxing cigarette purchases will result in less of it and the new tax probably wont result in a significant reduction in the citys homeless population the city estimates the tax will produce 1780 units of affordable housing even though its own resolution says it needs more than 17000 none of that is an argument against the tax as council member herbold points out this may be seattles only available route toward making its tax code more progressive despite the fireworks at public hearings the tax is relatively modest and is specifically tailored to affect only the companies that can afford it nor is it the only tax of its kind wilmington delaware denver and plenty of other cities tax companies on the number of employees they have a socalled head tax this week as seattle debated the 75 million head tax the chamber of commerce released a report estimating that solving homelessness would cost 400 million a proposal by the mayor to reduce the revenue to 40 million triggered an even more raucous committee hearing with protesters chanting 75 million no extortion to another packed audience the original proposal passed and will be voted on monday but the mayor could still veto it but that is the debate here what has become possible and necessary to the city to fight over whether to spend 10 percent of what it will cost to solve homelessness or 20 percent but the bigger question is how cities should respond to threats like amazons the request for proposals for the companys second headquarters stated explicitly that a stable and businessfriendly environment and tax structure will be highpriority considerations cities responded in kind chula vista california offered free land fresno california offered control over how municipal revenues would be spent chicago even offered to waive income taxes for amazon employees the calculation these cities are making is all about the multiplier every job created by amazon creates another 15 in indirect employment consultants chefs schoolteachers except those employers wont get any of the tax breaks perversely its only the largest companies the ones with the most power and the littlest need for unfair advantages who get cities falling all over themselves to give away revenues its not even clear what seattle gave up to entice amazons most recent expansion here the company didnt respond to inquiries about how many employees it has in seattle or how much it pays in city and state taxes though late last week a person at the company familiar with the data made a rare disclosure to the seattle times that amazon had paid 250 million in local taxes without specifying what types of taxes or where they went no matter where they operate companies have every incentive to play exactly the game amazon is playing to shareholders every dollar a company pays in tax is waste the minute amazon announces its second headquarters location it can start pitting its host cities against each other hey seattle were thinking of adding another 1000 jobs its you or pittsburgh what are you going to give us this is in fact almost exactly what the ceo of zillow warned this week we are actively trying to decide where to put the next couple hundred heads and this is the type of thing that causes us to consider looking at putting that expansion in other cities he said the challenge of finding enough revenue to adequately run a city is only going to get worse excluding health care federal grants to cities are at their lowest since 1980 despite the growing economy 30 states have revenue shortfalls the trump administration has declared its intention to cut transportation funding and housing assistance without outside support cities will become increasingly reliant on revenues from their own voters and their largest employers seattle is a case study for what those fights are going to look like the more desperate cities become the more leverage corporations will wield over them and simultaneously the more frustrated their populations will get at the constant tax raises and fee hikes the most depressingly insightful comment from wednesdays city council hearing came from howard bess a counselor for the downtown emergency service center a homeless shelter in seattle he apologized for being tired he had been up all night helping seattles homeless population find an island of relief i dont see that anybody who is opposing this is going to die on the streets he said or not be able to pay their mortgage

science theres a big difference between science and science fiction but scifi books and movies have inspired some of the greatest minds of today the best of the science fiction films will stimulate a curiosity and an interest in a topic astrophysicist dr neil degrasse tyson director of new yorks hayden planetarium told vanity fair in a june 2014 interview huffpost science reached out to top scientists and science enthusiasts to ask which science fiction movies and classics were their favorites here is a slightly condensed version of their responses primatologist founder of the jane goodall institute and un messenger of peace three books of my childhood probably had the greatest impact on my life the story of doctor dolittle by hugh lofting and tarzan of the apes by edgar rice burroughs inspired me to understand what animals were trying to tell us and instilled within me an equally strong determination to travel to africa live with animals and write books about them the miracle of life was a large book my grandmother got for free by saving up coupons from cereal packets it was by no means a book intended for children animal scientist and author of the autistic brain im a star trek fan the one ive always liked the best was the one about the whales it had them coming to earth and dressing up as earth people some of the later movies havent been as good theyre going with too whizzbam special effects historian of science and founding publisher of skeptic magazine my favorite scifi film is the 1951 the day the earth stood still a christ allegory in which an alien named klaatu who takes the name mr carpenter while visiting earth admonishes humans for threatening nuclear annihilation and insists that they will not be allowed to join the planetary community as long as they retain nuclear weapons senior astronomer and director at the center for seti research stanislaw lem wrote a short story golem xiv in the early 1980s that is my goto reference when anyone asks me what will the aliens be like no theyre not short hairless gray guys theyre intelligent machines and while lem wasnt talking about aliens in his story i figure that any extraterrestrials we ever detect really are likely to have moved on from biological brains to cybernetic cerebellums my favorite scifi movie has got to be the first incarnation of hg wells war of the worlds dating back to 1953 anthropologist at the natural history museum in london brazil quirky with humour and horror juxtaposed and full of little details about the alternative world that terry gilliam creates and michael palin outstanding as a nice man turned into a torturer by the system astrophysicist at johns hopkins university as a card carrying astrophysicist i tend to like my science fiction to be plausiblescience fiction my usual rule for such work is you can make up one outlandish concept that has some foundation in science and then the story should follow the consequences of that concept here are ones i like contactcarl sagan the fountains of paradisearthur c clarke childhoods endarthur c clarke the songs of distant eartharthur c clarke the martian chroniclesray bradbury fahrenheit 451ray bradbury foundation seriesisaac asimov silo sagahugh howey the standstephen king watership downrichard adams the day of the triffidsjohn wyndham paleontologist at montana state university and

growing up at the end of the cold war and like everyone else im still trying to figure out 2001 a space odyssey materials scientist and author of newtons football parable of the sower octavia butler made me pause because it described what the future could be in a very believable way star wars excited all of my senses and made me think that anything was possible we all have a hero within astrophysicist at the space telescope science institute the books that fascinated me the most as a child were those by jules verne i count here in particular around the world in eighty days journey to the center of the earth and twenty thousand leagues under the sea in terms of films i remember having been impressed very much at the time with 2001 a space odyssey with dr strangelove and with close encounters of the third kind rocket scientist and author of mathaphobia one of my favorite sciencefiction movies is gravity starring sandra bullock as a rocket scientist i was blown away by the stunning visual effects and threedimensionallike movement plus i am thankful that producers and writers cast a woman as an astronaut to bring science concerns to the forefront of american and international discussion also back to the future starring michael j fox time travel in movies wasnt uncommon before 1985 but the concept of building a ground propulsion machine from a delorean car inspired me to investigate aerospace engineering biologist and author of scientific americans the urban scientist dune the old one with sting i love that movie with its messages of imperialism

economy climate change could bombard the us financial system on many fronts and the nations growing dependence on natural gas for heating and electricity requires particular scrutiny as regulators scramble to catch up on the threat thats the conclusion of a landmark report from the financial stability oversight council the federal entity established after the great recession to guard against future economic disasters it marks the first time the council has deemed climate change an emerging threat to the us economy since the council was created as part of the doddfrank financial reforms of 2010 are we behind of course we are a senior administration official on the council who declined to be named on the record said on a press call this is the starting gun going off for the us financial regulatory system the assessment came just days after british regulators called on companies to disclose strategies to swiftly zero out planetheating pollution and their european union counterparts outlined plans to test banks ability to withstand climaterelated shocks emphasizing the political challenges the us faces in confronting the crisis the biden administrations plan to cut roughly onethird of the nations emissions appeared to die in congress setting policymakers scrambling for alternatives this is the step were taking to catch up and put ourselves in a leadership role internationally which is where we want to be said the staffer who has worked at fsoc for 10 years and this is the way to do it the myriad ways warmingfueled disasters or hapless attempts to avert them could upend the us economy unfold in dry sober language across the reports 133 pages financial contagion could spread from the physical wounds of climate change extreme weather and flooding may render regions of the country too costly to insure condemning entire communities households businesses and governments alike to economic and financial precarity with unclear options the mounting toll of physical damages could wipe out the income properties generate or destroy the value of assets used as collateral posing credit and market risks to banks insurers pension plans and others the report states another threat could come from the solution to climate change itself with each passing month that pollution from burning fossil fuels and felling forests for cattle ranches increases the speed of change thats required to avert cataclysmic temperature rise climbs if countries take divergent paths and fail to coordinate it could sow confusion or create large inefficiencies thereby possibly straining the financial system the rapid shifts could also quickly make previously valuable investments virtually worthless delays and years of complacency eventually require larger more disruptive policy adjustments which would likely have more dramatic effects on economic activity and asset values coal the report notes is already widely viewed to be in irreversible decline with 65 of us plants shutting down over the past decade but in 2019 the us had nearly 200 gasfired plants under construction while natural gas produces less carbon than coal it still spews tons of climatechanging pollution including methane which is an 86times more potent heat trapper over a twodecade period than co2 reaching the us goal of netzero emissions by 2050 would require sizable reductions in the use of natural gas the report warns suggesting the value of gas assets could plummet even more chaotically than coal a thorough assessment of the potential for stranded assets in these sectors should be a priority for financial institutions in their risk management processes and a component of a regulatory scenario analysis the report states the senior official declined to comment further the report which president joe biden called for in an executive order this spring is unprecedented and sends a strong signal to industry to wall street that regulators are waking up to this issue and taking it seriously said david arkush the managing director of the climate program at the consumer watchdog public citizen still he said it is extremely far short of what is needed it almost reads to me like the memo that should have started this process in may when the president issued the executive order the document could have offered more prescriptive solutions including calling on the federal reserve to cap how much of an investors portfolio can include unmitigated fossil fuels or proposing banks that own risky oil and gas assets keep a certain amount of cash on hand said ben cushing the campaign
